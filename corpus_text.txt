My anaconda don't want none / unless you got buns hon...  I'm a terrible father!  _B_  Hey Hon? Would you help me get the plates down?  Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as...  "gay as the day is long"?   It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.   Hi honey!  Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.You wanna...?   Previously on Friends...  Man, I sure miss Julie.  Alright, no peeking. No peeking, no peeking, no peeking.   WHOAA!!

Can I see the comics?  Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck.   Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldnt go out with a guy like Chandler...  Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there.   Hey! New wallet, huh?   Hello.  Hey!  No, look.   All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!  Oh, yeah, good idea.   I'm fine, thanks.  Right! And when is that due?  She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.  Now, have you told anyone else?  Hey!  Whats the matter?  Theres the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?   Betrothed    Hi.  Food? Uh-huh gimme!   Why?! Whats happening to the coffee house?!  Oh!   Yeah I am!   I LOVE MY NEW JOB!

OK, thank you very much. _B_  All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I dont know, we were, we were making out.  How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.  Y'know if we ever go to war and youre captured, youre in for a big surprise.  Come on, no peeking!   People can hear you.  Chandler, theres a guy right over there.    What is that?  Monica? What time is it?  Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.  That was a half an hour?  What are you doing?!  All right now, memorize it.  You got it?  Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?  You have no respect for anybody's privacy!  When?! After the birth of our first secret child?!  Ross didnt get the annulment Sure, neighbor come on in.   I miss Rachel.  No, my parents.  And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."  Yeah, you didnt get one.  Uh-huh!  Theres still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?  Oh my God! You cleaned!  Look at these floors! You did the windows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And nagging works!  Yes! Now, theyre a little more than I normally spend on boots or rent   I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got here!  Hey... hey listen... What do you guys know about investments?  No, I think we should save our china for something really special...Like, if the Queen of England comes over.   Uh-huh.  But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true.   Hey sweetie.  I'll put a pillowcase over my head.  Oh my God!  Oh my God!  So how was Joan?  You ever figure out what that thing's for?  Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?  If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.  Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?  Alright open your eyes. _B_  Come on! You guys can pee standing up.  Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?  Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.   Huh?!  Hey what are you guys looking at?   Hello.  I know!!    Ha-ha.  No, its just Im so pregnant that Imy guitar doesnt fit anymore. So I thought til Im not, Im just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!  I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.   What's the matter?!  Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.  What are you guys doing up?  No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.  And thats every month?  Joey we know you steal our food.    Hey! So, whats with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?  You told me.  Oh Willies still alive!  What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?  Hi. Okay, will that be all?   Hey!  Oh, yknow I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. IWow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?   Yeah, its just yknow  Since when are you into swing music?  Old?  No.  I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!    Hi.  Come home!  I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in.   You too.  We need to talk to you about something.  Oh!  Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.  I guess so.   Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.  No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everything.  Yeah, so.  Makes me feel um, peaceful, heh-heh, please.  Give it to me.   It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!  Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?  Look, were not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!  What is that noise?  Chandler, dont worry! This doesnt make you any less of a guy!  That does!  What am I sitting on?  I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.  God! Ooh! What is that smell? Its coming from the bathroom. Ooh!   Absolutely.  Well, they're not mine!  Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!  Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta.    Is that your card?   Wow! How'd you get in there?  Okay.   Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!  No, you wait! This is ridiculous!  Uh, no, shes at dance class.  Yeah, and yknow, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four. _B_   Here, check it out. Its the first one, too.   Whats up?   Hey.  Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.  Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?  I know.  Hey!  Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.   Hey!  twice as big as Allessandro's.  What if something gets broken? They're so expensive!  I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.   Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.  As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die.  So, excuse me for being a little skittish.  With good news?  Of course it is not good news, you just said  "Doctor Connelly just called". If it was good news you would have said  "Doctor Connelly just called! " But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem with me or with you?  Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!  Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!   Sex!  She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!  She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!  Dont tell me, because of the big nostril thing?  Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?  Huh? Days of our Lives picked up my option.  No, no, its just my tooth.   Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?   Oh, no-no, no-no-no, theres none of that in here.  Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.  Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!   Maybe he found you flip-flop.   Emily's cousin kicked me out!  All right, then massage me up right nice!    Dark red.  Whoa!  Ahhh.  Yknow whats more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Yknow whats even more generous than that?!!  Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadnt been on the toilet.  Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her?   Oww!  What?   Hello?  Hold on please. Joey, its your mom.   Oh, my mom called, theyre gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so were looking for a good picture of us.  What? That's like insanely easy!  No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, its all yours.   Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs.  Thief.   There it is! Oh, look at that! Isnt Mother Nature amazing?  Chandler.   Thats right. Im no longer a bride. Ill never be a bride again. Now, Im just someones wife!  Yeah! Have a great honeymoon!  I just had the most amazing bath.  Oh, that is so sick.  I dont know how to tell you this, but I think that Monicas cheating on ya! I told you that you shouldnt have married someone much hotter than you! _B_ Right, look. If you cant come home and deal with this, then I'm gonna  You're really not coming back?  Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold.  Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.  I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.  Pardon?  Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?  Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.  You want me to sing?  Give it to me.  Why?  No! Rachel, thats what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I dont get through, theyre not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! Its us versus them!  All right. But, youre gonna have to tell them.   Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.  Sorry.  Yeah, they're mine.   Hey, what's-what's going on?!  Hi Chandler!  Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!  What? What?!  Yeah, but, hey look, dont go through her stuff. She gets really mad.  Because they dont know were dating.  Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?   That is nice and were done. TADA!   What?  Yeah. And yknow who shouldve shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.  Oh, cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, theres your admirer.   No! No! Its just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!  Oh my God.  Congratulations.  Haaaa...  ... ahhhh!  Oh! I would love to read a poem.  No! But I know exactly what Im going to say.  Uh, oh-oh, umm no you didnt. I did.  Well then who?  Im sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like, "Oh, these are way too expensive for you."  Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean.  Well, I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank.  I didn't say that! It's in a bank guarded by robots!  Ok..but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over...  What are you doing?  Oh, play them!  What?  Thanks.  Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"!  So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?   What are you guys doing?  Come on, they were not that huge.  There's my little boy.   Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.  Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.  I know.  Multiple orgasms! Opening Credits _B_  Hey.  Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?  Okay, but only if you give me a drag.  Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?  Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.   What kind of changes?  Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I mustve hit something on the remote.  I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.  It's so good, isn't it?  Hi!  Okay, maybe it wasnt my best decision. But I just couldnt face another failed marriage.   Oh my God!!  You serious?!  Hey.    Hey guys!  Hey.   Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandlers eyes!  Thats not true, there are great pictures of us!  Right, yeah, cause its close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute.  Why, why not?  I will.  Oh yeah, right.   Oh no, I already packed. The only thing I couldnt find though was your Speedo.   Wait, you like them with me.  Is Joey here?  How can people do that?...  Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots! Opening Credits _B_  I just heard him!  It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!  Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.  Are you kidding?  Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure...!  Guess what happened at work today...  Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.  I got a little drunk...and naked.  Because she's your lobster.  Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?  Woah, woah, woah, what're, what're you talkin' about man.  _B_ There you go, enjoy your coffee.  No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I cant see him.  Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.   Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this!  Thats my Moms writing! Look.  Great!   What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything  Opening Credits _B_  That is one good looking man!  That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?  Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.  Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!  Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.  Okay! Okay! Okay!     It is'?  Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didnt.  Oh, here.   Uh, oh-oh, no you didnt. I did.  Oh dont even ask!  That sounds perfect!  Huh?   Lets just do it right now. Okay? It wont be hard. Just say whats in your heart.    I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then  Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.  N No! We took a cab too, but I did test runs!   Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.   I'm dead?  Oh... what does that mean?  Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.  Yeah, I guess.   Bob here. Opening Credits _B_  Uh-huh.  No plans, huh?  Is it? Feels like two.  Well, actually Gunther sent me. Youre not allowed to have cups out here, its a thing.  _B_   Eh, do you believe that?  Well, I never call me. _B_  Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit.    Oh my.  Opening Credits _B_  Yeah, whatever.    No, we didnt even pay our cable billmaybe this is how they punish us.  All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.  Say good-bye to sore muscles!   I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!  No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity anymore.  Its a girl! Anyway, it wouit wouldnt matter. Okay? Because Im a teacher and shes a student.   Oh my God! Its Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!   Okay thats so generous!  Chandler.  Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?  Well, you-youve always had glasses.  Oh my God! Thats the creep that youre with at the Statue of Liberty.  Nobody cares about the Dakotas.  _B_  Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.    Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! Whats wrong with me? Ooh, dont open that door. Opening Credits _B_  Thats not til Thursday.  No, they were really cool. They were on their honeymoon too!  Oh, baths are so relaxing!  So have you called her yet?  No. Right, Im going in!  Why not?  What, it's ok when Chandler does it?   That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!  I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.  Hold it, hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.  C'mon. Let her. Yeah.  Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.  C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya know, holding claws like. . . _B_  Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash. OPENING TITLES _B_  Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.  No. See now I don't think you're being fair. I mean one night you see me and you get scared, I mean, what about all the other nights when you don't see me, huh? What about last night when you went and got a drink of water and I was nice enough to hide behind the door, what's that about, huh?  Well Ross was hangin out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....  No-no, why dont you hang on to that one.   Whoa!!!  Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.  That would be Casey. Were going out tonight.  Great!   That's very nice.  Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?  Good-bye muscles!! Opening Credits _B_  It's uh, 27 dollars even.  Oh God, here we go!  That's it! Thanks Pheebs! _B_  No.   So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! Ill see you then.   I cant believe Ross went out with Rachels sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.  Youre gonna mess it up let me do it.  Okay!   What is your job?  No way! Look, Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up, pretending to be someone youre not  Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!  All right.   And next up is a marching band from Muskogee, Oklahoma.  Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.  "Hey Chandler, it's Charlie"  Chandler?  What... I could, I could do it. What is it?   Excuse me?  Sounds like he's with someone.  Or "Win, Lose or Draw".  I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... Anything we want.  Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.   I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.  Whichever one you want, man. Whichever one you want. _B_ Not that one.  Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?  God that is good TV. OPENING TITLES _B_  Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See _B_ honk honk.  What?   Are you intrigued?  No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.  Booo!!  Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.   Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses!   Hi Mom, it's Jill.  Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.  Just go up to her and ask her out.  Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?  So are things with you and Joey any better?  Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so shed have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.  Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!  Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!  Ohh, no, no. Were not going to just sit.  Shhh.    Hey! Dont you give me any of yourHey!   No! Forget it! OkayI mean thanks, but Im done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, whats next? Come on.  Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."  No, but it is frowned upon.  Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.  It wasnt the best.   Oh, heres a great one.  All right, I got 48.  Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.   Yknow what? Actually Im kinda glad theyre leaving cause uh, I need to talk to you about something.  They wont be ready for weeks.  Yeah, can we go call them? Is it too soon to call? I wanna call.   Give me that!   Theyre mine!  How dirty do you think I am? Im telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.  Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and its always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year Im going to make them cry.  Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.  I heard him again! _B_  What? It's, it's just a phase.  Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.  Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok. _B_  Carol?  What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?  Your boobs are fine. look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here.  Oh, can't make.... hands... meet.... Opening Credits _B_  Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.  Yeah.  Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.  Great, you can cover Chandler.  Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.  Well, Im really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit.   Come on you guys, it's no big deal!   No, things are fine with Kathy. Im having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.  Oh, wait-wait!  Maybe its a pickle?!  Opening Credits _B_   Whoa, hey, that ladys all kinds of naked.   No. No. No.  Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR.  Hey!  Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.  Hey, where's the chicken?   Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?  Another lie. You have a sickness!  No.  Well, um, because mainly, um, they dont like you. Im sorry.  Hey you guys.  Oh we kissed it up real nice.  Im sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny.   Yeah you got 5 years left!  Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!  Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.  If she says no, can I have the ring?  Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music  All right, I should get going, big day at work. Yknow Im in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out Im not brain dead.  Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.  Did she really say that?  Oh my God, this is horrible!  I can't get *enough* dinosaurs!  Yeah. Cushions the blow.  Oh please, hit by a blimp?   Oh my God!  I could be a secretary.  Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! "Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm"!  I know.  _B_ Ohh yeah, that's the stuff.  Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.  No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.  Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call. _B_  Oh. Hel-lo!  Her what?   Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.  No, Im getting back down cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but shes like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.  I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?   Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.  Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?  This is how much we pay for electric?!!!  I think it's insane.   Fine! Ill do it without you!  I dont need you or anybody else! Im gonna make it on my own!  Youll see!! Youll all see!! Opening Credits _B_  Hey you guys!

No, I will not shut up because Im engaged!  Ohh, big talk! Huh, why dont you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancée will kick your ass!  Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20! _B_  Well, we didnt have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.  Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.  Thats true!  I knew I married you for a reason!  I don't know.   Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you.  Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus yknow the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I dont know, gal pal Rachel Green?  Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!   So sexy.  Honey.  Oh my god!!  Great. Ill see you when you get here. Im gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out.   Here you go.   Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.  Ok, you really want me out?   Wow, it is easy.  Now, I can have milk everyday.  Opening Credits _B_   Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom is suddenly without a queen. Im so depressed Im going to slash... my prices!! Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! Im going medieval on prices!  Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.  Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.   Hey!  Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her.   Fine by me Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!    Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out!  Guess which job I got.  Well, Joshuas coming in tomorrow and since I dont have the guts to ask him out, Im going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.  Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money.  So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.   Great. I'll see you later!  Uh, yeah.    All right, youre right. Ill talk to her.  Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that youre really sarcastic, or that, yknow, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.  I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Yknow, everywhere I look shes like   I came over here to tell you guys.  No.  Do you guys know any cute guys?  Yes!  regular celery.  Ive never done that.   Fine, I can do it.  Whew.  Honey, Im not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but Im going to wear them all the time. Youll see. Besides, I love the compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?  Where’s my granddaughter? I’ve been practicing my magic tricks.  Oh, dear god! *Opening Credits* _B_   Oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment? Richard!  It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand.  Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.  I'm sorry too.   Chandler!  So, ehm... I'm proposing to Pheobe tonight.   So, ehm... I'm proposing to Pheobe tonight.   So, are we gonna get together or what?  Why don't you play with your roommate?  Morning, hey, you made pancakes?  Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.   I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.  Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first youre really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.  Really? Whos number two?  Just pickle.  Done! I did it! Heh, whos stupid now?  Opening Credits _B_  Oh yeah?  Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you  never go out of stylewhat did you throw away?   But, I love you.  I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!  Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isnt that why you guys are here?  Think it'll work?  Id bet Id still be doing my kara-tay.  Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from yknow, not doing anything else physical.   Ill be waiting. Opening Credits _B_  Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh!  Okay, umm, I just wanna say that I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night.  Our special night. I mean it just wouldnt be myour-our night, if you all werent here to celebrate with meusDamnit!  Sorry, Im kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.  No, its Its not that. Umm, now what Im going to say to you, Im not saying as your friend. Okay? Im-Im saying as it as Monicas older brother.  Okay.   No, it's not just that. It's justI want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh...   Well I-I really dont remember the name of it.  Well, neither.  Sure.  Her answer machine?  Honey why don’t you go lie down.  Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.  Oh my God, that's Charlie!  You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.  C'mon give me five more. Five more.  You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.  Ok, then I want to hear you say it, I, I want to hear you say you want me out.  Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?  So, Chandler, whos on your list?  Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe itll take your mind off Janice, and if you dont play, everyone will be mad at you cause the teams wont be even. Come on.  I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish, and he said you played here a lot, so umm....   Im gonna be on TV!!  Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?   Oh.  Oo! Is it for my birthday present?  Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?  What?  Oh, theyre just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.  Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?  Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.  Sorry.  What the hell was that?!  So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?  Im a man.  Look, I know that I shouldve told them. I know I shouldnt care what they think. Im sorry.  Hey!    Okay!   Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.  Im sayin I see a difference.  Okay, weve been out here for two hours and we havent seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandlers getting chilly.   Oh, Greg and Jenny yuck!  Hi Greg, Im Chandler this is Monica. Hi Monica, this is Jenny. Hi Jenny. Hi Greg.  Oh my God!!! Monica!! Hes the stripper from your bachelorette party!!   No.   Oh-oh! Okay, shes kicking!  Are you kidding me? Watch!  Well I cant do it with you guys watching me! Opening Credits _B_  Yes, I see that here. Unfortunately we cant guarantee a private room and currently theyre all unavailable.  That's right. Is it true, that the reason you are here in Tulsais that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job withoutrealizing what you were saying yes to?  My dad told me. They play golf together.  OH! Stupid long sleeves!   You're not gonna be here new year's eve'  What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi! Opening Credits _B_  I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!  Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.  Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.  Chandler?  Great, I'll see you then.  Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.  I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.  Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?  Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.  Cause she uh, she steals stuff.  Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!  My boss, Joanna? Wow, that mustve been awkward.  Hey, hey.  Umm, that papers two weeks old.  What?  What? Oh!  Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.  Look, Chandler, its my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they dont print the name, so it doesnt really matter who gets credit, right?  And what if I was still fat?  Well, you wouldnt be dating me, thats for sure.  Hey Chandler! Yknow that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?  Thats the title! Yeah! Yknow they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.  Awww, come onwaitstop it. Okay, to Monica.  Okay.    Well hello! Shes cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?  Not for the next few minutes.  Nothing! It was something.  What?  Well, you justyou put a quarter in and yknow pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something.  I dont know. Its-its just lately, Ive been feeling Okay, heres what it is  You know what? I feel a lot better, thanks!   So, uh, why didn't you say anything?  Why’re you so tired?   Nice!    Nice!   Seriously stop it, or I'm gonna jump on ya.  _B_  Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.  Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.  Guys, you got your hair cut.  Five more and I'll flash you.  No no no, I wanna hear it from your lips.   Good morning.  Now, you do realize that shes a cartoon, and way out of your league?  I know. I feel horrible. Okay.  Yeah! Theyre putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channels gonna film it!   Hey guys! What's...   Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?  What is the big deal? Its not like were exclusive.  But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?  All right, yknow what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?  Joey and  Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!  I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.  Hey you guys, guess what?  I know...   Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids  Luck!  The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!  Okay!   Ross! Stop it! Come on!  Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?  Well, how much do you think he needs?  You really think thatll work?  I know. And shes so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.  Hey!  Hi!  What is it?   Hi Monica.   Yeah!  Chandler what do you say?  I dont care. Phoebes Phoebe. Ursulas... hot!   Then why are you wearing Monicas jacket?  Hey, yknow whats weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people youre gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." Thats weird isnt it?  We found your test in the trash, if youre not pregnantIts because I am.   Yknow what? Why dont you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here?  Your secret bachelorette party  Whoa!!  Oh Im working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it. Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out.    Oh Phoebe, thats a great story. Can you tell it to me when youre getting me some iced tea?   Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!  I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you?   I guess I'm going to come up with a really good reason why I wasn't there! The producer is going to be so mad at me...He sat us all down yesterday and said everyone has to be there six AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani!  Like I was some kind of idiot!  No!  "Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."  Uh!  Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.  Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys.  Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.  Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "Hey, you're not Bob."  One. . . two. . . two and a half. Okay, just show me one of them. _B_  What is that sparkly thing?  I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.  Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?  He could never get a woman like that in a million years.  Hey.  Hey, howd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?   You ah, you didnt say Yes to that did you?   But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes.  Pretty, huh?   Hey.  Hey, yknow, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know itll be Valentines Day, then my birthday, then bang!before you know it, theyre lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody!  Yknow, I want a man!!  I mean, it doesnt even have to be a big relationship, yknow, just like a fling would be great.  Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.   Oh no-no-no-no!  Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't  Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.  Yeah, yeah I think Im gonna find my own place.  Theres a lost and found?  My shoe!   Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.   Hey guys.   Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!  I dont know. I dont know. I cant lie to him again. Oh no Ino! Im just gonna press my breasts up against him.  Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports team!  Not really, I got to drag him around too!  Opening Credits _B_  Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?  Nope.  Are you joking? Check out is not til noon and he has a good  eleven minutes left.  Who?  All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but thats different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean?  Lets.  Opening Credits _B_  So when do I get to meet Emma and show her this?    ...AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT!  --- Opening Credits --- _B_  No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.  Ok!  Ok!  I used to have that bumper sticker.   Hey.  I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.  Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist. OPENING TITLES _B_  Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer.   Oh, thank you. Opening Credits _B_  Oh, I had the opposite dream.  Thanks. You ready to go?  'Kay.  You got all that from the back of her head?  I know, but all that work youre doing to get it ready, I just   No, you messed it up. Youre stupid.  Yeah.  Janice?!  Oh, thanks Gunther.  STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!  Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day  It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut "  Really?! You?  I can't believe this!  Yeah!   Okaaay.  Any of you guys want anything else?  Why dont you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.   I dont think youll ever get my parents that drunk! Opening Credits _B_  Well, dont get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.   Hey!  That's great!  Its gone.   Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh   Would you like some pancakes? Opening Credits _B_  Yeah.  She untied his G-string with her teeth.  Somebody stop me!  Wow that was a big one.  Its a dead dog.

Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.  Oh my god. You are pure evil.  No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.  Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!  Oh.  That had to hurt! _B_  All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.  Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.  Now she's passed. _B_   Hello, Rachel.   Just be yourself. But, not too much.  Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.  Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!  Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!  Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.   Well, I didnt realize until I got home. I wasnt gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Yknow what? Im gonna go find that guys car and leave a note on the windshield.   Hey guys.  No, its my joke, its mine. You can call them, theyll tell you.  Ohh!  Oh well listen, anyway shes directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!  So what do you guys want for an engagement present?  Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldnt be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monicas older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down and kick your ass!  What? Im-Im-Im serious!  ComeHey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? Im-Im not kidding here!  It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?  You told me you hate massages!  I cant! Yknow? You guys dont know what its like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.   Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.  See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?  See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?  Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.   That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!  I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.  Alright, I'll be right back.  We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew...

Not you!  Just stop it! Come on!   Don't come out here! _B_  Whats the big deal, yknow? Its not like its a real marriage.  No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?   Hey!   Yes, of course they like you!  Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives!  Oh-hey, theres Carol again!  Why?  Hey!  Amazing!  Okay, okay take a guess.   Making holiday candy for the neighbors.  Oh!!  Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?!  Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember?!  Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until yknow, he screamed out Radisson at the end.   Oh hey you guys!   You think were being obvious?  That's not true. If you don't wanna smoke ...  Hey.  "I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."  Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.  Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.

I mean every other way hes like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.   Good luck!  Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's?  Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?  Damn!  We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.  I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...  Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.  It was okay. Shes still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.  No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!  Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.  Well, why dont you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.  No problem.  Yeah.  "Smoke away."   That's how old you are.  Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!   "...and I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll"!  To use the bathroom.  We make fire. Cook meat.  To use the bathroom.  ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.  Agh, it was the graduation from hell.  Hey!  Yeah!  Oh.  Oh, no thanks.  Hey, Rach!   Thanks!  I dont understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a big, dull dud.  Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?  Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, its like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, lets trade!  I dont know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but theres this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.  Yeah! Wait a minute, its been a long time that Ive been single. How come you never offered this before?  Well at least, Im going to mute it. Joey and  I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here! _B_  Did I, uh, did I miss something?   Okay.   Yeah, they dont like you.  Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.  Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right? Opening Credits _B_  Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.

Wait a minute, who told you?  You are dead meat.   Hi, Julie.  Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered.  Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.  Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan.  Hardy Boy.  Okay, well maybe not on those levels.  But honey he calls everybody by a nickname!

All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, Ill love you like I do in that black thing that you like.  Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the Geller Bowl.  A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so cliché. Why don't you get a magician?!   Would you like to call somebody?   Two.  Hi!  No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.  Shes mad because I know todays her laundry day and that means shes wearing her old lady underpants.  Oh no-no-no!   We are! Help us!  Need a new table.  Yeah!!  Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!   I have not been sick in over three years!   Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?   Hey!  Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy? We call him Hums While He Pees.  No.  Yeah.  Shut up!  This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasnt allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!  You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.  That man across the street just kicked that pigeon!  Oh!  What?  He's... our age.   Ooh, I want one...

No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!  You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?  I dunno, maybe its because youre really sarcastic. Or maybe its cause you uh-  Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!  I know.  No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.  Lets go watch it at your place.  Ugh, how can you even ask that question?! _B_ _B_  So was it a lot more money?  Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?   Oh umm, theres also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina.  What is that?  Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.  Why?!  Wow Bing! Burning the midnight oil.  Yeah. Okay.  Whoa!

No its not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven. _B_  Hello?  Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?  Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didnt have to walk me all the way back up here.  With a K.  Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"  Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.  I justI cant believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.  I just came up to say, "Hi!" Hi!  And you, sweetie, Ill see you tonight.  Yeah, you wish!  I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.  Hey Pheebs, how's it going?   Would you mind doing a picture with us? _B_  Okay, well Ill bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, theyre not actually puppies, theyre Frank and Alices triplets.

So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?  See? This is exactly why Im making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.  About a half an hour.  My God, I cant believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!  Hi.  Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.  OkayOop! Too late! Im leaving! Come on Chandler lets go!   Uh-huh,  and you?  Oh!... Right!  "Here we are, the official Powerball numbers! We have 53"  He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.  What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?  What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?  You have a third nipple?  Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?  Come on, quite yankin' me.  ...Yes?  You made a joke right? So I laughed.  Chandler!!  Promise me, you will end it.  No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...   I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.  Don't get me started on that.   I don't know. I'll just handle itI'll ask you to talk to him!  Oh-oh, Pottery Barn!  You can throw the rest away.  Chandler, Chandler, yknow what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.   I just found out that Elizabeths dad wants to meet me.  ... the WENUS?  Are any of you guys free tonight?

With time-a to spare.  Lovely! Opening Credits _B_  Yknow actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system.  Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep!   Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more." _B_  Youre a joker Bing.   Okay, so when youre done with your tea Ill look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.   "A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet".  Whoah!  This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother. _B_  College?  ooh...  ...and head to Canada!  Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...  Try it, I can't feel a thing!  Monica  Are, are you kidding? This is packing?  Do we need a cake?  That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?  Is that supposed to be funny?  Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, Ill divide my perspective canidates into catergories....  Why, nobody good?  Hey Chandler, theres a party tomorrow, youll feel better then.   Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?  What are you doing?   It's Chandler!  Are you OK?  Yeah!

I dont know  You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states.

Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so... ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.  Dude. You're married to my sister.  So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?  Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.  So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that .  Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her.

It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.   Hey, divorced men are not bad men!  Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.  Oh great!   Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'  Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go.  See this is what I was afraid of, I didn’t think I should be here either but somebody  said he’d be over it by now.  You can come to my house!

No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.   Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either "Liar, Liar" or "Betrayal", or...

I mean I just cant, you know that Im not good at confrontation.  Thats a good idea for a business!  So what are you doing bringing her here?! Theres people here!  Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!  C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.  Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.  Yeah.  Yknow, I really have to tell Rachel, but I We just have to get it over with! Yknow, the next time we see them were just gonna tell them. Okay? Thats it.  Well, she told me that Im gonna die this week, so Im kinda bummed about that.  Hey! Ross and   Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, dont worry about it!   Hey Mon, do you have another pillow?  Yknow, something a little snugglyer?   Ahoy!   Oh no! No! No!  _B_  Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica  Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.  No. Sorry man.   Youll tell me later?  Of course, of course.  Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.  Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.  I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!  The hell with hockey, let's all do that!  Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity.  Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesnt really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think its gonna make a difference _B_  All right, were gonna play.  Dont you have to use the bathroom?  Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? Im gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.  Hey!  What?  Hey, it's not like it sounds.   Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what.  I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!  No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.  Come on!   So, whos the lucky guy? _B_  Oh, Pheebs, Im sorry, Ive got to go. Ive got Lamaze class.  Yeah, why not?  What about the second minister we met with? I kinda liked him.  Did that guy just call you Toby?  Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!   Okay! Ill be right out. Im slipping into something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty.  Awesome!  Dude I just did something terrible.  Why?  Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a bloodhound ...and the breasts of a great goddess.  I dont want him to think that I'm having an affair.   Mr. Bing's office.  No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.  Hey guys!  Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!  Let's get out of here. _B_  OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right. _B_ Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really good, I think I'm ready for my penis now.  Based on this play? ...Based on this play! _B_   Hey!  Well, umm, my Moms friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.   Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!  I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted to watch.   Boy, that was-that was, umm terrific.   That-that is a good trick.  You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.  Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.  What was that?  Pretty much.   Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!  Yeah, I know!  So, what do you think?  Shes sleeping.  Wouldnt you love to do it just once?!   " when I look back over our time together "  Well, Im sure theyre still somewhere here in the hotel. Ill-Ill help you look for them.  'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there. _B_  Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line,  you know that's bad for the paper tray.  Ross just read me his speech. It's fantastic!  Ross just read me his speech. It's fantastic!  Bedsprings, unmistakable!  What?  Oh! Any word on casting yet?  All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.  Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building.  Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!  What are you doing?  Because it's a special hat. _B_ See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler...  Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope thats cool.  Hm-mm.  Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book  and found nothing! I want a name thats really like, yknow strong and confident, yknow? Like-like Exxon.  That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.  Hey!  Dude, some guy just called for you.  But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesnt see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesnt like me very much.  Did she just ask me out on a date?  Hey! I made that for her!   Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.  Oh yknow whats sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.  Oh that is quite all right maam.   Well, she saw the ring.  Why do you think she's having so much fun living with Joey? 8 Well, why dont you correct him?  Yeah, just relax.   All right! Lets play Bamboozled!  No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!   I'm gonna go.   Yes. Because all good plans start with Ill just go down the fire escape   We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.  Will he know what this is in reference to?  And he has your number?  All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.  I want a baby.  Hey, Missy...  Honey.  Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.  Consider it done.  OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.  I'm Gail.  Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.  Great. Ill ah, see ya then.  Hey-hey, check out the hat!   What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.  You're kidding! Oh, I love him.  No, my eye doctor is Richard! I cant go to him when I dont have a boyfriend!  Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.  Well be starting with apples.   Can you hear anything?  That noise you just made?  I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?  Oh, So you can move them!  OK.  Oh Monica! Guess what! _B_  Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.  If you wouldve let me finish, it goes on to say that hes probably not gay. _B_  Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!  Maybe I should open a divorced mens club.  Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is whats going to happen to you if you wake me up.  Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me.   So hows the game?  Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M.  I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.  I love you, St. Valentine.    Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-PhoebeBurrrrr!   If you want to check your email, just ask!   If you want to check your email, just ask!   Not until you said it. Somebody switch!  Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with.   Hi...   I got them! _B_  This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.  You got a problem with that?   No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.  Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sisters beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, shes a porn star.    Stop that now!   What?  And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas!  And you know what that means buddy!   You didnt cry when Bambis mother died?  Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.  Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.  Really? So she said, she didnt wanna live with me anymore?  All right, what about the third guy?  Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!  Chandler! Phoebes hogging the game!  Because it kinda looked like I did.   Welcome home. I've missed you. join mein the bedroom?  Arent you afraid that Joeys going to figure all this out? _B_ I heard it! _B_  No-no, we do it every year!  Ross says hi.  Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!  Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.  But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?  Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.  Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?  I, I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you.  I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?  Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'  Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think youre chances are pretty good.  All right.  _B_  Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck.  Im gonna, Im gonna get my ah, my fiancée man!   Well?!  Oh. What do you do?  Oh please!  Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?  In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.  Really? Your work laugh?  Okay listen, yknow when you move in Rachels room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?  I dontshe said yknow that Id have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.  Yknow what   Hey!  Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!  Oh, its great! Its a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.   I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.  It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.  You take your time.    Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.  No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?  What?   Yeah!  Yeah! Yeah! I mean Im sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but yknow Chandler always supported my career. Hes paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.  Careful. Careful.. CAREFUL!  Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.  We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.  Look, c'mon, please? It's not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I am a professional actor!  Oh, man, I'm two hours late for work! . Look, here's a copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in.  Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.  You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!  Yeah, it's really 600 tomorrow night our time.  Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point. _B_  Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?  All right, we have to pick captains.   Yes. _B_  Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.  Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joeys your pal. Joeys your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, theyre hanging out with Joey."  Someone at work ate my sandwich!   That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.  Or maybe, its because youre hanging around here at 1130 on a Wednesday.   Okay fine! Ill-Ill just tell her its an antique apothecary table, she doesnt have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.  Chandler theres nothing wrong with crying! I mean you dont have to be so macho all the time.  Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?  Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?  Well, she actually has a boyfriend yknow herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.  Chandler? Can you give me a hand?   Can you blame him?   Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel?  Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? Its not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!!  You only think its stupid because you suck at it.  Ow! Ow! Ooh! That hurts!  Oh, its so sad they never had a chance to meet.  Great! Great. Then I mustve left it at Monas. I knew it!  Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand…   O-kay, so you wanna play it that way, do you?  I'll tell you what. For the rest of our lives, I'll be careful, until told otherwise. _B_  Scary pigeons back?  This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?  Ok.  I'll let you get acquainted.  Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?  So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?  Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?  It's not that bad.  Well at least we know she's a woman.  Dont you ah, dont you wanna ask me any questions?  Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out.  Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?  All right, check me out.  Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.  Oh my God! Youre pregnant!  Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really havent thought about it that much.  Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore _B_  Its your turn.   Oh, thanks.  Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?  What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.  Oh yeah? When?  No. _B_  I dont believe you! That is brilliant! And Monica has no idea?  Uh, double latte, extra foam.  Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?  It's not the time Charlie.  It's not the time Charlie.  Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses!  Nancy doesn’t smoke!  Right. I'll be there.   Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.  But don't you need experience for a job like that?  ...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.  Hey, how do you guys get anything done?  Ohh, thank you.  I didnt think you were gay. I do now.  Yes. Yes. Yes.   Oh well, hey, Joeys loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, hell be there.  Ooh, Madlibs, mine!   My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!  This is so cool!   Hey everyone!  Yeah youre right. I dont know what I was thinking.  No.  Career counselor?  Huh?  Well then we still have a problem.  Ohhh! Make it stop!  Oh, Im so sorry. Um, and maybe Im wrong! I butyknow Im gonna go out with him again, Ill find out more.  Its not just the stuff he paid for, I mean its-its everything. Yknow? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didnt get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didnt believe in myself.  It wasn’t my ring! It fell out of Ross’s jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!  Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here... _B_  You don't need a shower.  I know! After you left the store I chose different ones.  Most likely.  Okay, I'm gonna be out there.  So, it's Monica and Chandler. I only know you as file 0W33815-D.  She died.  You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.  Chandler, Chandler.  Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.  Well, ah, Im an actor. Im fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and dont worry Im totally okay with the gay thing.   Hey!  Yes!! Yes!! Im the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.  He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.  And its not fake, its totally brutal.   Oh-oh-oh-oh!  What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus its just, its so different from the stuff you usually hear.  says $30 Father Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.  No.  I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!   Hey.  I dont know, yknow? I feel a little umm No, yknow what? Never mind, Im gonna be fine.  Yeah! Roses or Lilies?   Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word.  Kind of what probably really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," yknow? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!" Yknow? You gotta take care of yourselves!  In this world history teaches us nothing!   Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?  Why won't I be married when I'm 40?  Is your team winning hon?  No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why dont you go home and wait for the thank you card?  Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...  I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?  Oh no, we have to!  - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.  You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?  Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot?  Oh! Secret teapot?  Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot?  Oh! Secret teapot?  Thank you.   So? What do you think of the house?  Boss!  _B_ Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.  Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me.  You mean like, music? _B_  Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, Im not looking for any thing serious.  Your mom was arrested?  You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.  Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.  All right! Thanks Pheebs!  On a totally different bet.  Come on man theres gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?  Well, Valentines Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldnt get her a calendar!  I don't!  Well, she cornered me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!  Okay, Ill see you tomorrow!  Just so you know, were not seeing him tomorrow.  I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?  I guess.  That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!  What do I smell?  I smell smoke. Huh--did yousmoke?  well, no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.  All right. Bye bye.  Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma.  Thank you.  God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totallynot worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.  Hi.  ...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.  Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. Im totally cool with that. _B_  Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.  No, but this wonder broom is amazing!  Yeah, I know what youre thinkin! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.   Really?  All right. Although I dont think we need one, I never stopped loving you.   Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job.  Like youd believe that. This sucks!  Oh, Im sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.  Oh my God!  Oh my God! Its like one mind.  What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick. _B_  Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?  Congratulations!   Hey guys!  Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry! _B_  Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.   Oh wait a second you guys for the last couple weeks Ive been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe hes the tea guy.   Okay, I got my note cards.  Do you got the presents?  Excellent! Lets play Bamboozled! Chandler, youll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?  Well then, you should look with us.  Bye bye.   Wha... what do you mean?   Wha... what do you mean?   Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look positively ghastly.  Damn it!   Isn’t it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?  She's gone.  Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic.  Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one.   Hey.  Who said it was for you? ROSS and  Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars. And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.  No.  Okay, get out of my kitchen!  Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?  Well okay, so then youre fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. Its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble.   ...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man...   That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.   Oh umm, not go.  It's almost our anniversary!  I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!  Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."  Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it wont be so bad.  The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!  Hi!  Thank you very much! Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you for the very first time, Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Bing!   Thats because he wasnt invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.   Im gonna go shave.   I know! I know it’s awful.  What was with the dishes?    Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler.  Oh! I'm gonna go wash up first.  Thanks!   Did someone drop the baton again?  You're kidding me? I mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. But on top of it, you're married to a reverend?  Did you talk to him?  I'm looking for Eddie Minowick.  Hey.  Oh my God!   Hey!  Oh God, is that Baywatch?  Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah!  Enh? All right, what do you think?  Hey, I thought you already had one.  I just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.  Yeah but it wasnt for me, it was for a friend.  What?  Werent you asked to leave sonny? _B_  What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriageable about me?  No, its me. Phoebe!  Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing What are they doing out here? The coasts all the way over there.  _B_  Its Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.  Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?  Whatcha doin'?  What, oh my God. What did you do?  What, oh my God. What did you do?  Just pass it to your boss!  Don’t you love the huge yard?  Dude, I was gonna ask her out.  What's the matter with you?  You thought I was Rachel?  Who's Rick?  Hey!  _B_  Nooo!!  _B_  No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that ones actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.  Oh! It's on! It's on!   Kidding! God, I feel wild today! _B_  Okay, the last thing   Hey! Happy Anniversary!  Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission.  You can go.  Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.  Hey.  And of course, crotchless panties.  Totally!  Oh my God, shes not gonna like the chicken that night either, is she?!   No! Drums! _B_  So just bring it back downstairs, whats the problem?  Honey, Im going to put my hand in your pocket!   She said yes.  Actually, he is buying a much bigger place. It's got a great view of Central Pa.....  Oh my god.  Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!   I don't get older. I just get better!  Joey's gonna be *so* upset.  Then, no.   Thanks.  Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.  Noo.  I'm sorry, it just felt nice.  Oh, Im sorry. Did I get ya?  Chandler!!  I'd like that. _B_  So is Joey around?  So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but Im already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.  Umm,  I love this touchy. Can I take it to work with me?  Yeah!  Doy! Probably right before she lost it!   ...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.  Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.  What do you have against the beautiful guest room?  All right, whats going on there?   See? Now, he could date her. _B_   Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?  Rosss apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?  But it hurts my Joeys Apple.  Well?  No, it doesnt say where it came from. Where would we return it?  I should know that. Lets see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.  Why, why would you open it?  Why, why would you open it?  Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.  And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!  Well, I thought it first, Holmes.  Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.   I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.  _B_ I've never wanted you more. _B_  Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.   What about the duck?  Will you calm down, hes just a human guy.  No-no, not for like another two weeks.  Noooo!! _B_  Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?"  So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London  I got you a present!  So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.  Really?  I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing. Maitre d' Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.  Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?   I know, I wasnt finished.   But dont worry! Were gonna go down the fire escape!! _B_  No.  What?! I thought hed love it! His favorite kid's book was the Velveteen Rabbit!  See Chandler? Im getting a lot of use out of them already! Theyre very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants   Dude! What are yoyou trying to kill me?! _B_ _B_  Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?  Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?  I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.  That's the door. He's gone...  You don't know that.  I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?  I'm Tilly.  Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?  Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.  Ooooohhh.  Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.  Calm down, do you want this unit or not?  Youre smoking again?!   Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-  So thanks for the warm welcome. Its good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, lets go out there and get em! Huh? And remember, there is no I in team.  I uh, dont really have a preference. You?  Really?! Wow! Thats-thats so nice, what are you gonna get me?  Hold on, yknow I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?  Oh yay! _B_  Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...  I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...  Where is the waitress?! Im starving!  Are you mocking me?  Where were your parents?  Great!  No, why?  That's my pie!  Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 800. Maitre d' I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.   Youve done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely.  Why dont we just find a place for it?  This is embarrassing.   All the appliances are included. There is a lot of light, a new kitchen... I think you guys would be very happy here...   What did it say?  What did it say?  So? Do you think we should get it?  Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want.  That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.   Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat...as needed. _B_  Can you believe this place?  Hello.  Chris says theyre closing down the bar.  Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.  Really?!  How did you know she would buy scotch tape?  Yknow what, I dont know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.  Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!  Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?  I know, but you have to open it today!   Ohh! Okay! Okay.  "There are three  primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.   Each of these theories  can be further subcategorized  into "  Nope-op! I insist!  You get the wine right?  You forget how many great songs Heart had.  Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?  Yeah, yeah you have the ring?  So-so you wouldve just lied?  It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling  Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!  With a wok?  I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.  What?! No! It was my idea!   Do you think he knew I was here?  _B_  What?!  Well, it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all.  So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but its not even like we know how to be with each other anymore.   Come on, it's fun!  Oh, I like that. Yeah…  What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.   Damnit! anybody got anything?  You guys have such a great place here.  Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!  Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!   It was you, pal.  The Ice Capades?  I gather by that oh that he told you about me.  Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself. _B_  No.  What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?  Well, you shouldve told me that before, Im not a mind reader. Hey, were out of beer. Im going to Monicas.  Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?  Well, maybe its so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.  Oh! Okay! Phew!   You! Chuckles! Whats your name?   Dude, Phoebes mom has got a huge peni...   Hey, its me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.  Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.  Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.  You guys are really right there arent you?  No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?  Awww!  Oh, heres where I win all my money back!   Hey, whats up?   Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, were gonna start with   Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.  Yeah-yeah, its down to me and two other guys.  Uh-oh! Uh-oh!   You need to give him money.  Its older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.  Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.  No! Thats where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?   Ive still got it!  What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!  What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!  Yay!  I think we should.  Me too. I'm good at it.  What if he reads it in the paper?  Go over there and tell that woman the truth.  It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all right? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.  Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.  Hey!  Yeah, apparently theyre turning it into some kinda coffee place.  Monica, what are you doing?  Ohhh.    Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!  Aww, man!  Boy! I didnt see that coming!  I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better. _B_  That's way uptown! That's like three trains away!  Which is great! I love to ride that rail!  And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.   Uh, never mind, I don't want to know.  _B_  You are so cute.  _B_  That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.   Yeah okay.  Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.   Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!  Open with a joke? Its a university, not a comedy club!  You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.  Oh! Oop!   Would it really have been that easy?  Yeah and well drop it off downstairs so that were not tempted.  Here, let me make the milk, Im up anyway.  Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!  Wait, wait, wait!   Oh that is so sweet!  How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we cant even be in the same room with each other?!  Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!  _B_  Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not good enough for you?  Uhm... no. Although I did have an uncle who voted for Dukakis.  Name one of his books.  Hey!  Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.  He's kind of intense huh?  Hi. _B_  Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.  And it works both ways.  No, I'm still married.  And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?  All right people listen, Ive got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.  Werent you nine?!  I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...  We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that Ill be there as soon as I can.  Oh, thats not true! Ive got her lots of stuff she never took back.  In the beginning where yknow its all sex and talking and sex and talking and  Sure! Whats up?   But youre still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.   I thought you said you were going to do nothing.  So that story doesnt make you cry?  Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?  Yeah and he didnt really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.  No, to get a table! Places like this are always shakin you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.   Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! Shes coming!  Well-wellsee? Parents are comin!  Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...  Oh, okay. Here, why dont you let me do it?  What is it?  I want a baby.  Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.   What is this?!  NO! I don't!!  NO! I don't!!   Yeah, we had a great time, thank you!   Well, I’ll just ask for it back!  This is huge!  You got it.  Go.   No, seriously.  _B_ I'll survive. _B_  Oh, that's OK. You uh, you had a thing.  Got me.  Yeahhh. Im tellin ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time.... _B_  Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.  C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!   Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.   Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!  Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!  That's the rule.  That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.  Yeah, okay. _B_  For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.  Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.  Oh dear God, let me think.   Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.  Okay that does sound like fun.  Look!   Do you still wanna call em? I wanna call em.  Yes I did! Im Chandler.  Dude, what happened?  Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?  Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?  I think youre right.   You know what it is? It's a nice place but I gotta see I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see...  Yeah, I could see it.   Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.  Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...   Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk.  Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?  _B_ A little what?  Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.  Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.  You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.  Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.  Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.  Yes!!  Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to  Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.  Whoa-whoa-whoa!  And the sex?  Hey!  Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!  Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.   Oh my God! Thats huge!  Wait a minute, why come I wasnt invited? And who was going to be your best man? Dont say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross."  Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, its going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.  By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.  What, you didnt get it? The doctor is a monkey.   What is that?  Oh, I love that guy!   Hi guys.  You've got to be smooth about it.  Crap.   What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors,  cute doctors, doctors who are cute!  Oh please, you just want more blue pins.  Whats the matter?  No reason. I-I keep private things in there.  Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebes. Why were you even watching it?  Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it’ll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet’s still available?  Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!  Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?  Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!  How bad you wanna smoke, right now.  Those are the pacts!  Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?  Hi.  I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.  What if we have to pee?  Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin'  So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.  Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?  Hey, did you pick a roommate?  Him? Him, Ross?  Okay, good bye!  _B_  Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!  Come here.  Okay, be right back.   I just asked that girl out.  How'd you get to that?  No!  Did I say you could smell it?!  No.  And monkeys cant write out prescriptions.   Oh thats good, I guess shell have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.  Absolutely.  So, twins... hah! Thats like two births.  Ouch. _B_   Hey, I can be smooth.  Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.  Maitre d' Of course, sir.  The second sister dies?!  I bet this will work!   Hey.  Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?  One.  What?  Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing "This is what my sister would look like"   Chandler, hi! I'm sure you've heard we filled the three positions. We just felt that with your maturity and experience, you wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant.  Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!  Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!  Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.  No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?  So'd you guys have fun?  Then be supportive like a guy.  What? He's cute!   Dude, what are you doing?  Yeah?  Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh  So uh, Emily called last night  What do you say?   I just... can't do it.  Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!  Oh! Tell her shes not marriage material. 3 Thank you for bringing her into our lives.  We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.  Oh no! Whats the matter?  So what are you gonna do?  Oh, its bad. Its really bad. The only thing in there that isnt burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!  Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!  Heyyy!! You got the door open!!   Well, are you going to be able to do this?  But... I'm ready, so, just deal.   That is so you!  Feminine stuff.  Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentines Day  you were right! Apparently, its about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having sex with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts!  Oh, wait a minute. Those arent stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?  No ones here!  Oh damnit! _B_  Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.  Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?  Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?  Oh, oh... maybe not you! _B_  Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.  Yes?  And who is this little cutie pie?  Yeah.  Oh, well great.   Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.  What?!  Is it the Italian guy?  Umm, oh, about three months.  No-no, stay right there.  Gettin closer.  Oh boy, I just love to sing!  Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.   We're switching rooms.  Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!   You knew about that?  Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!  Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!  I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents?  Why do they have to become people? Why do they have...  Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?   We can't do that.  Your joke? Well, I think the Hef would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.  Im just so nervous! Yknow? The callback isnt until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!  OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?   Great! Thats great Monica! Great! Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile?   Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.  How did it go?  The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?  What?  Noo! I came down here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you I still love you.   Where is the James Taylor CD?  Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a sex tape...  Wait a minute... This says Monica...  And this is Richard's apartment...   No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.  Chandler, you were the strongest person in the program. We're offering you the position of junior copywriter.  Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!  Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!  Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.  Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? Head she wins, tails I lose.  Wait a minute...  Go-go-go-go, come on!   So uh, what did you find out?  Have you ever seen so much crap?  Really?  Right this is staging.  What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?  Is Brian...?  Yeesh, whatd you do about it?  Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more  Okay.   Why? Just because youre not mature enough to understand something like that?!  Yes it is. See.    Yeah the material feels so softhello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?  What do you mean?  Oh, so you like her too Chandler?  No-no, we do it every year!  Nooo!  Okay.  Whoa!  Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning  thirty.  So the bus boys took me out for some drinks.  I wanna puke on you later!   Uh sorry, wrong number.    Hey!  Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me you-youll let it go.  Honey, whats going on?  Thats kinda nice.  A little tall.  Ok if everyone’s on board, it’s settled, Chandler,  Chandler?  Ohhh! Put it out!  No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?  Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.  Thank you.  All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?  Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?  How did you...  And she's not crazy?  Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen.  Well OK then. _B_ Was that the oven timer?   Ok, bye.  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.  I suppose mainly sexual.  Hes so cute.  Chandler! Youre smoking? What are you doing?!   Hey!!  Oh, look at us! Who wouldve thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails.   Nice shoes, huh?   Have you even had a girl up here?  No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change.  Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?   It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!  Ok, ok, How about if we split it?  I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!  Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.  But we can go, right?  Its almost 8 oclock, its almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?  Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think Ill show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.  He hates to lose.  Im sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?  Hi.  You said you loved me! I can't believe this!  Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, were just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.  Yes, that's right. We're excited about the level of sophistication you'll be bringing to the job.  Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these  Not with soap!!   How is that the silver lining?   Look, look, I have elbows!  _B_  Bye-bye.  _B_ This is clearly in the wrong apartment. _B_ _B_  Chandler!  Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.  Y'know what, I like Kathy.  Oh.  What happened?  Then what is it?  I am famished. What do I want...   That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.  Well, if you really wanna know, I'mOh! I can't tell you this.  Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.  That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.  Uh, we might be leaving now.  Now, its you little bunny friend.  _B_  Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today when I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she she wished me good luck.  Noo!!!   So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if theres anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all.  But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.  Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school  Thank you!   Mm-hmm.  Yeah.   Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller?  There you go.   Are you on board?  Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow .   Ok. I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny...  Oh yeah? When?  He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.  Thanks.  It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.  Bye. _B_  Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. _B_ Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats _B_.  Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.  Hey, you know about that?!  Oh look, the pool tables free. Rack em up. Ill be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.  I got you something! Open it! Open it!  Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.  I know! And Im just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!  "My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."   Yeah, you are!  I scared you! Present Day _B_  Yeah  Well, I didn't know what else to do!  Are you thinking about Monica?  Okay!  I-I-I dont even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Yknow what? Im just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.  Dont worry, were just gonna search here for an hour, them were gonna go over to Joeys and search, OK?  Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?  My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these   Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs. _B_ _B_  Youre not a lefty?  Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.  You wanted to see me?  Yes, you did!  Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. It was amazing!   Well you look incredible too! Youre justyoure so fit!  Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?  Is that a real place?  Are they hiring?  Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.  Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!   Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.  Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?  Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? _B_ Alright that's Ross.  I-I know. Well if something comes up...   Y'know I dont, I dont understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin her boob.  I know.  _B_  Yeah, she's...  Oh, okay.  Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!  And youre afraid you wont be able to fill his shoes.  Come on!  Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?   Hey roomies!  You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?  Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.  Good! Good! I was just testing you.  C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.  Thats the way I did it til I was 19. _B_  Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.  She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.  Bye-bye.  Oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the Brazil nut.    Hey!   Yes, they can stay with us.  Ross!!  No, its more like a  good luck.  Noo!!  Oh...  Im Monicas maid of honor. Okay? Dont try to blue pin me!   I dont think this numbers right!   Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good? _B_   Hello Chandler, lovely day huh?  You!  Chandler, we cant let this tape wreck Valentines Day!  Yeah.   Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?  We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!  Ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and I'm flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. Can we just talk about something else? Monica &  Why won't I be married when I'm 40?  Oh, man!  Nuh-uh.  No problem. Hey Chandler  Good luck Chandler.  Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?   Where there is no fear of commitment.   Stick out your tongue.  Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. Its been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.  Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?  Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.  Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.   Why not?  Yeah, I can do that.  Okay, I'm gonna go too!  But we have to!  Well, Im not going to go now anyway .  Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.  Yeah!  All right, maybe you dont have to smile. Lets try something else. Lets try umm, try looking sexy.  Which is bad, because?  No.  Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner? _B_  You love me!   Soul mate.  Hey Chandler, why so fancy?  You got me a cola drink?  Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!  No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.  I think it's great you guys are doing this.  Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Bleeth.  Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...  Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?  Ennnh.  You love her.  So what did you do today?  Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.  No, but Im gonna!  I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...  Hey!  Hey! Any good mail?   Hey guys!  Oh God, yeah.  Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?  Oh, yeah.  Okay, hold on just a second.  Im sorry, its for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please? _B_  She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.  Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk!  That they know of.  Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when theyre done with them they just send em back.  No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!  _B_  Boy, do I have a surprise for you!  Child-birth, its a natural thing! Its beautiful.  Yeah!!  Listen uh, I-Ive been doing some thinking, and I dont know whether its because were here or Rachels giving birth but umm, I think we should try to have a baby.  Ravioli's delicious!  Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?  Oh.  FOOTBALL!  So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?  Ok. _B_  Break.   Hey!  Oh no! Where to?  Too Paris?  You really didnt know? _B_  Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?  Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug.  Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.  Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don'tI was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.  Hey!   You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?  Why, are you moving out?  Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.  Well then, you should look with us.  Have you seen your guys body?  Your... excuse me?  Whoa, whoa, whoa!  Wait, I think I know someone who does that.  Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.  Oh, because, you know... they don't like you.  I don't know.   We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man.   Peach pit.  Hey, hey, they're runnin'  Amazingly, that makes sense.  Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.   That was  surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?   Hey, you guys! Take a look at this!  Check this baby out, dug me a hole!   Oh, it looks great!  So big deal, so Joeys had a lot of girlfriends, it doesnt mean hes great in bed.  Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.  Ooh, its probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, Im kinda .   Okay!  I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.  Really?  Yes! Why, did youyou forget to make yours?  Okay Phoebe calm down, theres no need to place blame. Okay?  I warned her about those candles. _B_  Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?   Oh and Chandlers about to cry.  Really?! You promise?  I dont know.  A cowboy theme? _B_  Some of them.  Then all your stuff would be here.  Here!   Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!  No, but someones really not going to get over that idea, are they?  Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!   What-what-whats that now?!   Hey, that is so great about the job.  What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?  All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!   No.   Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.  Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!  Oh, well no problem there.   Come on, Pheebs lay off him.  Really?! Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?  Uhh, because Im trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick hes looking over here, say something funny.  Okay, now you're even cuter!!  You'd tell me if you were moving out right  Hey!  C'mon up.  Hey babies! Oh, Im having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche Ive got the keys too, still there!  Oh thats okay. Hey, actually in a way its kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!   Chandler, arent you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?  I hope she throws up on you.    Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?  Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?   Hey sweetie.  Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Wont happen again. I wouldnt want to do anything to hurt your... "wenus."  _B_  They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?  Settle what?  Good.  Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?  No. Not after what happened with Steve.  I thought you knew that.  Yess!!   Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?  Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?  Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!  Oh, its just like a bloodbath in here today. _B_  Hey, dont call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry! _B_  Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell.  Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?  Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.  Well, I could cut it.  Sweetie, with you its gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, cause you-you guys are in love.  What does she mean by 'involved'?  Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.  Hmm thats weird. I dont remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.  Okay.  Okay, I cant wait! This is going to be the best Valentines Day ever!  I cant believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!  Chandler, is that   Oh my God yes! Who is she?   Who is that?!  Okay. I love you so much.   Hey!  Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?  Then youd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesnt make any sense.  Its your suitcase. Were going to Las Vegas.  Okay.   Well I I havent actually told her yet. I dont want to scare her off, yknow?  I drew you a bath!  Yeah, just dont get your hopes up.  And I like to think I had a little something to do with it.  Well?  Everyone. Erica, baby!  Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.  Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.  Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here.  Okay, you're in bed...  Im serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.   They have the best stuff in there. _B_  Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love.  Sure! Where are the seats?  When?  What-what-what is so funny?  Hey!  What?  Aw, I know all about Kip!  Oh good!  What?  You should see the treatment I get when Im with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.  What, are you crazy? You havent beaten me once since my injury plagued 97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.  Just us.  Oh yeah, like there are police for that!  I cant tell you. Its a secret.  Ohio!! Thank you! _B_   oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi!  You found Betty! Oh my god!  This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room,  Where's Joey?   Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.  Hey, finished my recommendation.  Here. And I think you’ll be very, very happy. It’s the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.  Did I do something to you?  Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.  Actually, nectarines, but basically...  Oh. _B_  Id really prefer a mountain bike.  Uh, 1030.  One more time, "Hey, dont you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"  Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunts dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?   You're fake laughing too, right?  so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.  Yeah.  Let me see that!  Chandler, thats not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And youve just gotten her one great present? I mean thats just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?  Hey-hey listen   Okay, here I wish you health and happiness.   Did you break up with her?  What about your breath?!   So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?  Oh boy, me too!  Umm, well lets see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.  You wanted it to be a surprise.   Were going to Las Vegas to see your dad. Its time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.  She stole my jeans!  Yeah, I hated her. She was horrible to me in high school. But hey, it was a long time ago, Im in a good place, it might be actually fun to see her again. You got any cakes or cookies or something?  No Will no!  Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff! I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So its a boy bath!  Not really.  Well, the interview  Youre ready to have a baby? My boys all grown up!  I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.  _B_  Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish we would win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job.  Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?  I'm gonna use the cushion.  Yeah, so?  Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!  Ohh!  So, will I like any of these guys?  Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.  I think you'll find this room more to your liking.  What are you talking about?  Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?  I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"  Okay, youre on.  Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom. 1 Awww.  But still no.   Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight youre gonna have a bachelor party.  Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, "Boss Man Bing".   Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.   So?  I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.  Welcome to New York City! Or should I say "ghe deu flooff New York City"?  Oh. _B_  If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum. 430 You think?! God, I, ah, Im in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachels all like, I love you and, and lets work on this. And all I can think about is, What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say? when I tell her what I did.  Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I dont think any of them are gonna work out.  Good! Thats good!  You have really great hair.  Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.  I know!  Don't switch hands, okay? _B_   Oh, I cant believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, yknow? And it wouldnt matter. Now I gotta be careful?!  Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.  When youre off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?  Why?  Okay. I can do that.  Yeah?   This one is uh Paul ONeil.  Chandler In all my life I never thought I would be so lucky.  As to fall in love with my best my best Theres a reason why girls dont do this!  No you didnt. Oh and honey, just so you know, now that youre marrying me, you dont get to win anymore.  Theyre kissing lets just go around them.  I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!  Oh okay.  I swear, if you try it, you will love it!  Yknow! You dont make a very good first impression.  Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird like mine is now!  Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.   Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey. _B_  Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...  I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.  Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her  and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.   I gotta go water Pete's plants.  Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.  Chandler!   They say he's only got half a tank left.  That's not possible!  And if you wait right here, Ill go get Ross.  _B_   Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.  So, do we have the best friends or what?   She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.  Oh right great! Welcome aboard!  See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.  Really? Okay, so why dont you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?  Well then let me do it!  Honey, we gotta go!  Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik?  Well, Im a potato or a spud. And these are my antennae.  So Sputnik, becomes  Spud-nik. Spudnik!  Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!  Yeah, yeah. They even do you.  Of course it does! It’s smart! I used the the-saurus!  So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.   Hello? Hi.  Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.  Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?  Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.  Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?  You wanna quit?  Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, Im basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.   Go on.  Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.  chords. Now, I don't know the actual names of the chords but umm, I-I-I made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them.   So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady.   This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.  Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?  All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. Im gonna go see my agent.  I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.  Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats! _B_  Hey listen, so whens-whens my audition? I mean I know its Thursday, but what time?

The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!  He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background.  Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!  Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know  Dont you see? Its the perfect crime!  Oh you dont know.  Heeeeeey!  Santa!   At the vet.  Hey guys, how is it going?  Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these  on my pillow.  Yep.  Yeah, losers talk!  Look, Ross look, Im on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff thats gonna get you in trouble.  Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!  Op, the ruined quiches are ready. _B_   You work with robots!!  Oh-no, dont try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.  We're switching rooms again.  I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.  Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.   Who got married?!   Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!  I will go for that drink.  Its wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.  All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I dont need any assistance in there, take a break!  My guy is well read.  Why not?  If you tell me, Ill tell you what Phoebe said.   How did he do this?   I dont have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does.  Bet I know how that discussions going to go. _B_  Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.  This is easy...Can't do this!  Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this.  _B_  You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'   Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here.  What if the baby needs him?  Dude, two times that happened!  Needs some clothes altered?  All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon.  You know what the. . . _B_  Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.   No, no, you cant, you cant, okay, you cant, you cant buy her pearls, you just cant, you cant, you cant.

Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?  Someone you didnt make up!  Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.

Thats a, thats a pretty great dad.  I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!  Come on! Come on, itll be fun! Itll make me feel so much better.  Yes, when I first met you, you were like, "Blah, blah, blah." I was like, shhh!  Hey!  What are you doing here, Santa?  Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I've got a question for ya. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it.  Oh yeah, let's do that!  What are you talking about? These aren't mine.  Hey.  Shoot.  Tah-daaah!  No, we are. Im sad.  Ohh, I like swimmers bodies!  Ugh, shes saying good-bye to her uncle.  I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.  What'd you say?  I just tell her, I have to get it over with.

Unbelievable!!  Looks good.   Oh my God, is it really that bad?  Oh, I hate this story.  Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.  No, in Ross's building!  She's back! She's back!  Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second.  Got it!    What's up?  We are so gonna find them this year.  Can I help you?  So youre playing a little Playstation, huh? Thats whack! Playstation is whack! Sup with the whack Playstation, sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!  Well, apparently she does.  Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate...  How long has that been there?   Yeah.  Whos Mr. Garibaldi?  I guess.  Oh, Id like a latte. Oh yknow what? If youre gonna talk about me, Im gonna go with you.   Well its just like youre trying too hard. Always making jokes, yknow, you justYou come off a little needy.  How can you smoke in this day of age? Do you not seen that adwith a little kid walks to grandpa, it's chilling.   Was your cabin pressurised?  I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?  She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.  You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it! _B_  We went through the same thing when we were adopting.  Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four.  That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.  ...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now. _B_  Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.  Pity food? Y'know what thats okay, all right, I dont need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.  No, Im good.  _B_  Op, I like credit cards!  Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if its like yknow, Chanoey?  Yeah!! Yeah!   Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?  This bicep?  Is that supposed to be an insult?  No.  Do you know whats a bad idea?  Wow! So, now youre going on a date with this girl?   Do you want our guy to be your guy? _B_  That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!  Yeah! I bet I can do it.   Oh my God. He threw up?  Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!  What? Wait a minute, I didnt pay, I thought you paid!  Yeah and the most important thing is that it wont be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. Itll be me! And I swear Ill do a really good job. Plus, yknow I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.  I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.  I just, I cant believe that we made it!   Did you hear that?! They bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon! Come on! Lets act like were on our honeymoon.  I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!  Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose! _B_ _B_  How many beeps?  I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.  So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?   What are these, like famous chickens?  Okay. I went down to the Mattress King showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.  Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.  Dude, I dont know.  No, no, that was my boss. I have to go.  Sorry, members only.   Hey dude, its me.  Oh my god.  Well, because she loves you and because you love her.  Hey, I'm more cop than you two!  Sure. Okay.  Yeah.  Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?  Come on man, really how old?!  I went back to Riffs. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.  It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!  Yeah.  Chandler, youre not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe its time that you let that stuff go. If your fathers not at your wedding youre gonna regret it for the rest of your life.  Fine. Im just glad I didnt give her my secret ingredient.  Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!  Nothing! I swear to God I didnt know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didnt believe in soul mates. So  So what? Don't you have any will power?  Okay.   No, I think we killed it. _B_  uhu uhu, check this out.    I'll do it!  Rachel used to live in that room.  This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.  Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.  Dont blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.  Well, so what does he do?  All right look man, I didnt want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! Its not even a name; its barely even a word. Okay? Its kinda like chandelier, but its not! All right? Its a stupid, stupid non-name!  I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, its-its so great. But at the same time Im thinking, "Well, Im gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."  Chandler!  Hey!  Thats right.  Did you hear something?  Youre right, Im sorry. Its not like youre yknow, going out with an ex-girlfriend.  Huh.  Oh, you dont have to do that every time.  This ring is from the 1920s, its a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires on either side.  Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebes old massage place is getting fired.  That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days   Mm! Seems like I wouldve remembered you!   Its still there!   Im sorry but nothing.  Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since. But um, I dont think its anything serious.  No dude, you gotta hold your breath until youre ready to answer the question.  Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.   What are you doing?  I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!  Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.   Yeah, I know.  'My scones.'    Well, I hope you're happy!   Well, I hope you're happy!  Well, thank you, Melanie.  Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.    Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?  She told us.  Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?  They were in his office.   I almost caught that one!  Yeah.  Why? Do you think hes still mad at us?  So, so, whatd ya think?  What are you doing?  Listen uh, Im really sorry, it looks like Im gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasnt there!  Oh.  Its this way? Sorry.  _B_  Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.  Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!  Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.  No, we never do that    Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.  Wow thanks!   She is so hot!  I don't know.  So I can do it?  Its a pretty cool tux.  Yes!  Alright boys, let's eat.  Yeah!  You said that was sexy!  No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?  Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead.  Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?  Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.   Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani . Hey, why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!  You both wanna do it? Uhm... there's only room for one.  Joey's bare ass!  Eww, I don't wanna do that.   Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?  Yeah, its hard okay, I only have two spots left.  Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake. _B_  I ran!! _B_  Your company has a fine foods division?  Im sorry man, I didntIm-Im sorry. Im sorry.   Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!  Hey.  Ugh, the worse day! Yknow, you think youre making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.  Whats up?   You dated her!  The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limesHey, what was in that brown jar?  Okay.  Will you marry me?  Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?  She could be out of town. Maybe shell be gone for months.  Well honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to.. to flip you out.  Chandler?  Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, Tris Holy cow, thats a big word. Trisc Seriously look at this thing. Chandler, how do you say that?  Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.  Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.  Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and the economy is bad.  I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number, we've won 3 dollars!  Phoebe is going to say "Yes" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!  Phoebe is going to say "Yes" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!  Phoebs, he's just a little dog. _B_ Ahhh. _B_  Oh, my.  Im telling you man, I saw it.  Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you dont want to be doing something and then look up and see something you dont want to be seeing.  Oh, I-I dont think theres any trail.  I-I wasnt in that.  Why?  Yeah, it mustve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.  All right, lets not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.  Hey, how do you spell suspicious?  Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!  Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?  No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.  No, I mean happy.  Hi, Monica.   Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth.  So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.  It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.  Yeah!  Chandler, you have an assistant right?  I know. Lets try a look of far off wonderment. Okay, well-well gaze into our future and well think about our marriage and the days to come.  Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!"  Hey! Dont laugh at him! Hes my drowning moron!  We'd be eating our soup right now.  All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?   Chandler!  You still on that?  Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?  Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken.   I don't do that.   What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!  Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously...  Did you think the neighborhood was homey?   Help me! This hurts!  Help me! This hurts!  Ok, have a good break-up.  Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.  Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?  I figure my character has kids.  Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.  Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....  Oh.  Would you like some gum?  Actually, me too.  Chandler!!  Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.  You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.  I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.  I could ask her to live with me!  Okay, this one I like!  Nothing.  I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!  Yknow dad, Chandler is one of Rosss very best friends!  Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?  Why?  No that could kill her.  Really?  No. Did you?  What a beautiful place. What a great night! I have to tell you, being here with all of you in Event Room C I feel so lucky. I think of all the good times that have happened here. The birthdays, the proms, the mitzvahs both bar and bat, but none of them will compare with tonight! My God, I dont want to forget this moment! Its like I want to take a mental picture of you all! Click!   This one right here.   That's right, because I forbid you to smoke again.  Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.   That's the fastest I have ever thought!  No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!  No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!  You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?  What?  She wants to meet you in person.  So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?  Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we...  y'know each would,  y'know  be?  Wait. I wanna show you something.  Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.  Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.  Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.   I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.  Thanks!  Chandler, what-what are you doing?  Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer?   I whitened them.  Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey.  _B_  When? Today? Some, not a lot.  No, I-I just dont know how you decide who to hire. I mean Ive got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then theres this guy   Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!  Uh actually, sorry I cant even make it. Im seeing Mona again tonight.  How do you get a monkey into a zoo?  Yeah.  I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy!    You son of a bitch!   Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.  Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.  Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.  Susan Sarandon.  Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!  Yeah, I can dance, y'know.   Well, Im from California.   Sorry, it's not.  Oh damn, I hate that.  What does the sign say?  And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?  I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!  Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?   Kinda.  What?  I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do? _B_  Oh my god. Janice, hi!  No! No! No! For my new fridgeour new fridge!  So Chandler, your parents mustve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.  No, so were protecting her.  Ohh, Im so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean its really, its made me stay calm.  I coulda been worse!  Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-ones turned them.  You see, if wed gone around them like I said, weShe wouldve given us those tickets. Damnit!  Mhmm.  I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.  Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?  No, I called him. It's not gonna happen.  No, I called him. It's not gonna happen.  I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.  There is a little child inside this man!  What is the big deal?   What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.   I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.  Ohhh, are you a puppy!  Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.  Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.   Yeah, I guess, but whats like heads and whats tails?   Excuse me. Excuse me.  Sweetheart!  Come!   Just a little gag gift somebody gave me.  Put your hands together.   Hey.  Oh no its fine, dont worry about it.  Yeah-no, stop apologizing, its okay.  Yeah! Ill talk to you tomorrow.   I should uh, probably go.   Janice.  You know more than one Fun Bobby?  You're driving me crazy with that!  Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.  Sorry! Sorry! Oh,  there!  Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!  _B_  I know! I can't wait!  And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler.   Yknow who I ran into from school? Howie.  Oh! Ross is sooo great! _B_   Are you interested in this ring?!  Dont worry about that man, that happens.  They cant all be bad.  Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.  Don't do what?   Good evening.   No! No, fear of the number 13.  Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.  No, it's not.   You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.  You know what? You can have mine.  That's great.  Can I see the book?   Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We’re really excited about getting this process started.  Please, you're going down!  Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!   Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!   I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it.  I gotta get out of here.   We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping...... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...   Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.  Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.  And!! Isabella Rosselini.  How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joeys sisters.  Oh, dont worry about it.  No, the No Smoking sign. Theres no smoking in my Grandmothers cab.  Oh, come on!  No....  Look guys, when Im with her its-its-its like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, yknow?  Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!  Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.  Auntie Monica!!   I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.   2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me?  _B_  So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.  I remember when we first got engaged.  But we should move quick.  What?! Chandler, shes our cousin!  Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?  Come on!  The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limesHey, what was in that brown jar?  Well I’m peeking.  Oh my God!  Don't joke  with me, okay? I'm very, very upset right now.   Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?   Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your rent is.   Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!  Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!  Who's this from?  Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.  That's who.  Oh, you didn't have to do this.  Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.    Morning. We ready to go?  Nothing. Im gonna take a shower.  Pretty nice?   Ill be back in ten minutes.   I forgot my purse.  Its heads.  Gentlemen, pick your category.  Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didnt really leave me much choice. Did you?  Or an uncle...  Joey and  Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I justI wanna be around her as much as I can.  So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?  Apparently Howies editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Yknow I-I-I havent spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!  No, you said the baby creeps you out.  Yeah! Once.  Hey Maureen!  Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin Maureen.  Congratulations.  Hey. We found her, we found the girl.  Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.  Exactly!!   Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?  Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life!  Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life!  What?  So?  No, Im not.   Im telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think hes baaad news!  Yes! Rent!  Ready?  _B_  I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!  Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.  Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.  Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.  Ross theyre really, really, really white.   Whoa.   Chandler. I sensed it was you.  And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.  Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.  Im sorry man.  Heres a thought. This is the same ballroom. Theres a band. Theres gonna be plenty of dressed up people.   Ahhhhhhhh!  Yes.  Yeah, is that okay?  Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.  ENDING CREDITS _B_    Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.  Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.  Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.  Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.  Rach, look!  Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me.  There he is. _B_ _B_  Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.  One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!  Yeah, make that three.  All right.   Oh, hey!  We dont have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? Weve got a canoe.   Knowing youre here, waiting for me I think its kinda exciting.  No, I really did forget my purse.  Commercial Break _B_  Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.  Its a good play, isnt it?   Hey-hey, whats going on?  Joey, is what she just said ummOh my God.  You were actually gonna    Isn't this great?  Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money.  So you know what I'm talking about, right?  Okay, what about after I give you these candies?   No. No, I wont. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didnt love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And thats how she ended up living with me!   Okay, thats a lie. _B_  We'll see. _B_  No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!  You said the baby.   How would you like to pay?  Okay youre right. Ill hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!  Okay, heres your milk. What do you want to talk about?   Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!  Dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover.  Oh! Yay! Look! Theres a piece that doesnt have floor on it!  Wait a minute, I-I believe Im entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?  Okay.   Err... Kind of.  No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!  "Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school."  I got you...these.   Well, yeah! Im still pursuing that.  No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.  So, youre like a zillionaire?   My folks.  We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?   I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.   Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.  I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.    Hey!  Oh.  Night, you guys.   Unagi. Im always aware.   You dont know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!  Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!  She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.  Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!   No-no-no, Im saying we-we buy more of this  at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody elses faces.  Oh nothing Im justjust was yawning.   No.  Nope. We took her to lunch.  Can I adopt you?   Go away! I don't want to see anybody.  Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby before them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs.   It's a... It's a boy!  It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!  It's a... It's a boy!  Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.  This couch belongs to us.  What?  Wheel!  We should?  Okay.   What ah, what is the matter with you? Whats going on?  Hey.  What?  You gotta take the canoe!   Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.  Horrible!  You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?  Thanks for telling me!   Yeah, no, youre right, I know, youre right, Im not, Im not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys.   I like them a lot.  Couldn't you just stay like this forever?  Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?  I'm gonna try.   No, it's too soon for you guys.  Ah-ha! Okay,  Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back.   And Chandler, youre gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel cant be late.  Hi.   I Gotcha!!  Yeah!  Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.  Told ya.   Okay, you go do it! Ill come back to that set! Ill meet more actors! Ill meet em all! _B_  Yknow what? Youre just upset because youre losing.  We are already latefor Phoebe's birthday dinner, so you point out put out thatcigarette, we're gonna put this fight on hold and go have sex.  Then it's okaaay!  _B_  Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.  Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems, it was for something for her.   Why do men keep talking to me like this? _B_  That's what it says.  Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.   Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.  Commercial Break _B_  Anything larger back there? _B_  Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.  It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee. _B_  Aww.  Ohh!  Wow. Okay, I dont know how to talk to you.  Sister 1  What cha doing?  Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.  Oh, now I have to go!! _B_  No Im serious. I mean Im intuitive, but my memory sucks. _B_  Oh, so, how are we doing?  I dont know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.  Clearly, Im having sex with him?  And lucky means, more cleavage?  What did you say?  No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.   All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?  Yeah, two hours, a lifetime thats the same.  Whats up?  I want this part so much! Yknow? If I dont get this part Im never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!No, I didnt say that! Thats a lie. _B_   You guys, Im sorry, could you please talk a little slower?  Here you go.  Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?  Im just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?  Honey, we dont really have to go to this thing tonight do we?  Oh God Phoebe!!  Oh thats it! Thats it! Right there! Oh!  Ooooh-oooh-ooooh  _B_  You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your familys. It's bad enough that we're working new year's eve.  Did I not tell *anyone* about new year's eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go.   Yeah.  Oh...  Excellent!  That's great.   Fortune! This guy is so stupid.  It's Count Rushmore!!   I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay?  What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?  Check it out, Giants-Cowboys.   What did you get her?   No-no-no, the kiss was good.  Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow,  I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."   No.  Are you okay?  You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!  Aww! I love you!  So, what do you think we should do?  Stop it Chandler.  Im sorry too.   Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! Thats like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo!  $500 that is a loooot of electricity!  Whoo-ho-ho!  I gotta buy some food.  Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!  Hey! Hows my pal Toby doing today?  Hey.  All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.  Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say?   Sex! This is the last day I'm ovulating, and when we don't doit now, we'll have to wait till next month.   Chandler!  Something personal.  Dude, you're not tanned.  I can't believe he did this.  Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.  I'd call that excessive.  Anything else?  Why not?  Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.  Quick volleyball question.  The fear?  Oh!!  Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?  Hey.  No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.  She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her!   WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!  Yeah, yknow at first I thought we could talk about this yknow, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I dont think I  Okay, so let me just get this straight. Youre accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?  We're so sorry.  All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.  I got it!!   Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someones eye out!  I know. Thats why I did it.  Come on, are they really that bad?  Oh, why dont you make her one of your little jokes.   Ahh! Arent you dressed yet?  Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?  Okay.   Ross, please! My make-up!    Im telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Arent these the same flowers?  Look at that! Look at that! Theyre going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?  I-I dont-I dont think that Im gonna wear the boots tonight.  Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?  Wow, that didnt take long. I thought you said Tulsa was a three-hour flight?  Naah... I couldn't leave you alone.  Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.  You were?  No, I just had to get a picture of this.   Amen.  Oh, you did it!  Oh, you did it!   No, no, I'm still working on mine.   I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?  You probably want us to move in together?  What?!  Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.  No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.  It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?  No, but thats bad!  Or Ill give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.  What-what are you doing?  Okay!  I know I love you!   Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures!  I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?  Yeah! Oh yes!  You serious?   I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.  See? Thats what I mean. I mean that, thats great! But I wouldnt trade in what I have for that. I mean Im gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and thats what makes me happy.  Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is, dont you think?  Well it clearly wasnt showering or shaving.  You-you must choose Mr. Bing.  Oh yeah!  All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...  Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.   What did you just say?  What?   Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.   Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.  Okay, if you say stop, then we stop.  Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?  Well then how come youre still at a job that you hate, I mean why dont you quit and get the fear?    The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...  Yeah?  Hows she doing?  Look, its not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I dont want to live with some one who doesnt know what it is to be a friend. So, Ill see ya.    The Irish gig guy?!  Acting! Chandler, this is my job! Im-Im playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!  Okay, Chandler, come on!  Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!  Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.  I can't believe you let them win!  Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.  Nothing!  No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, thats just gonna mess them up.  She will be after tonight.   You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?  Yknow what? Shed-shed love this.  Uh, its an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.  Were supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.  You don't like puppies?  Here.  Now I only owe you $49.50.  Chicken? I could eat some chicken.  Chandler!  What about the chairs?  Me neither! We have to get in!   Hey-hey! Bing? Was that Bob from six you were just talking too?  Well yknow, Im just-Im just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!  Why not?  Huh, Chandler  youre home!  Besides, I can't leave until their Christmas party downstairs clears out; there are some *pissed off* insurance people looking for that ham.  Huh?  Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?   Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?   Hey now you have two. _B_ Oh, now you have two.  Yeah, it was really hard.  Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.  Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.  Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um...  Im sorry Dutch, I didnt get that last little bit.  No?  Yeah!   Why not?  What?!  Hey!  There was a seen in Footloose...  Wait-wait-wait-wait!  Come on! Come on, lets trade! The timings perfect, I just clogged the toilet!  Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!  Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!  I love the "I forgot the present" fake out!  Thats a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!  Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.  Listen, we dont have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.  Okay, get ready to owe me!  Hey Joe!   Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!  Choose, you jackass!   I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?   Huh, and no cuddling.  Sure...  Chandler walks into Joey's apartment]  Oh! It's not good.  No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?  So, you were both dorks. Big deal.  Okay.  All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard!  Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand! _B_  It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.  Hey.  Dennis.  I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.  I dont know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just dont want to be 30 and still work here.  Well yeah, dont-dont you think its a she?  Yeah! You did! And thats why Im leaving.   Oh, wow. I cant believe youre throwing that in my face.  Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?  I was frustrated.  All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream,  but I don't want to talk about it.   What?!  Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didnt actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.   Wh?! What about my allergies?!  Oh hi!  Hey!   Well, its a funny story.  How about the place settings?  Oh my God! Oranges!  Oh then you know each other.  Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots dont really go with it.  I dont know. Ooh, I bet its Richard.  What are you saying?  I have a badge in it.  Yes!   Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you!  Oh, we are so lucky!   Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you!  Oh, we are so lucky!  Hey.  No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?  Honey, this will help.   Here you go.  Okay.   Im really sorry but I may be a little while longer.  Can you really do that?  Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.  Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl  Yes! Didnt you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didnt read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!  Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.  Oh.  Ohhhhhhhhh . _B_  Oh that's okay. Dont worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.  All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we dont get married.  Totally!   Okay, here we go. Ready? _B_  Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside.  You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.  What is the matter with your hand?   Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you?  Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great.  Really?  Oh.  Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and...  Okay...  Great...  Great...  All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow!  Okay..  Okay...  Bye.  Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.  Oh good, I hate it when you do that  What's up?  Wow.  I decided to pee.  Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.  I know. He has your eyes.   Oh.... my God.  I know. He has your eyes.    Have you been here all night?  Hey, hey, look at that talent.   You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?  Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head. _B_  Well, anyway, I got to go change, Im ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.  Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"  When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!  Ill tell you what, Chandler, why dont you call me when you grow up!  Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?  I was frustrated with you!  That was my dad!  Well, it involved Monica.  Really?!  No! No! No! Noone can beat me.   Why not?  Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?  It's too cold.  What is that?  What did you do?  Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?  What do you think of adding him to our team?  Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, Ill wear the boots. In fact, Ill go into my room right now and yknow try the outfit on.  Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe shes having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!  Its awfully pink.  _B_  What?!   Ble-blah-blar Blargh!   You wanna see it?  Yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he would call me and he didn't.  And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...   Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.   How come you have two?  Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.  No, no, that wont be ah, that wont be necessary   No, y'know what dont close it  cause the... keys...are in there.  Hey Mon, lets give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.  A couple of hours, I feel awful.  Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you   Nana?  Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...  Its the Knicks!  Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.  Oh and you know what I want!  I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that.   Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.  Oh good.  Really, ythink so? I dont..  Commercial Break _B_  Chandler, why would you do that?  Alright, alright. Then maybe you wont mind if me and my friend takes a look around then. Huh! Where you at? _B_   Oh.  Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!  We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.   We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.   Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.  Hey Chan, is that Joey guy gonna come by and pick up his moose hat or should I just toss it out?  That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.  Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice. _B_  That is never good.  All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.  What?  She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.  Yeah! But if wouldve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldnt have worried about it so much! See you around!  Whats that song? It has been in my head all day long.  Y'know what really bothers me? Isit's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!"  I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.  Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!  It's no big deal, I do it all the time.  Noooooooo! _B_  Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip shed heard all year.  Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I dont think its the kind youre gonna like.   Hello?  What are you talking about? The auditions not til 500!  Well, nobody told me!  Whod you talk to?  Nevermind!    It hurts my teeth.  It sounds like its coming from across the street.  Im sorry, would you move your thumb? I cant see the seat number.  Really? They love him down on six.  Hello?   You dont think its a little crazy that you get all my points just cause you  Brrrrrrr!   So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?  What?!?  So you're not friends with him? Monica and  Wait! Wait! _B_ Girl No. 1 Hey, you. He's just adorable.  Get out.  Wow, look at that. The car is on fire, yet somehow it's expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax.  Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?  Mar-gha.  Yeah, yeah, yeah!  Whats going on?  As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so Id call him.  Ooh, what a shame! Because with her face  and her chest  I could really put something together.  I cant!!  Im sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.   Althea!  Really.  Whoa!  Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.  I do not have baby fever!  Oh no. _B_  Ready?  Changes?  How are you still single?!  How?! When?!  So you uh, nervous about getting married?  You think this is clever?   But, ehm... you watched the tape?   Being a doctor must take up a lot of time.  I know. This is really, really huge.  All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.  Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks.    No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.  Where's Buddy?  Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?   Hows my Bing-a-ling?  Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!   My lighters in there!  Commercial Break _B_  Hey! Who was up from 2 oclock this morning until 5 oclock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?   Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...  Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.  You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!   Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!  My God, Rachel, I cant believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, Im so jealous.   Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!  Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll.  _B_  The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!  Are you still awake?  Right, okay, then no. _B_  What?   Sir, this is not a first class ticket. Im sorry.  Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.  You know what? I-I think Ill wait out here.  Bedrooms clear, although you might need some new pillows.  Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.  We're okay. I'm still ovulating.  I'm adopted?   I'm really happy for you guys.  I'm really happy for you guys.  Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.  Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff.  Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.  Look, what do you want me to say?  How ya feelin?  Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.  Thats Bill Clinton.  Im in my bosss car!  Okay. Bye.  I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.  I took a shot.  What, uh... what juggling thing?  Huh.  Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.  _B_ Joey and  Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!   Come on eight.  Youre-youre-youre gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?  Good. What made you change your mind?  Okay. Okay.  Yes honey, I made it myself.  I cant do it. I cant do it.  Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!!  _B_  Well it was Chandler! We didnt think hed ever propose!  See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And there is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs.  Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!  IN LONDON!!!  Look, look lets pretend its a real bachelor party. Okay? Yknow? Before your wedding. Come on, itll be fun.  Hey wait a minute, this one isnt dirty.  Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.  Really!   You didn't watch the tape.   Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.  Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.  Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.  Yeah?  My fish, Buddy.  It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.  Ohh!   Why are your eyes so white?  What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look,  'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!  Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?  Ohhh, here it comes.  He is right, isnt he?  Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?  No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.  Yeah!  Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.  Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.  Thank you. Uh...  Chandler, please, come on. Look at him.   Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Lets do something crazy!  How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part couldve turned my whole career around!   Thank you, its my moms. So this is the kitchen.  _B_  Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.  _B_  You do know that was me who just said that right?  Hey. As long as were both up  Yay!  Nooo!!   Hello all!  Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I wouldve done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and thats just for ugly people.  But we really do need to find someone up here. The work is starting to pile up. Ive got a stack of documents on my desk this high.   Oh.  Whats wrong?  Yeah, so far nothing stupid.  Get down?  Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about new year's eve. Where is everybody else?  So, let's do this.  What was that?   It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.   Phoebe here with the cab yet?  Wow.  The guy that's about to kick your ass talks like that.  I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna  pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.  Gunther, I quit.  Oh my God! Thats Pete! But why is Bill huggin Pete?  Althea is correct.  No.  Bye Chandler!   I miss you already.   You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!   No!  Chandler, this actually bothers you?  Well, its a set and they should probably stay together.  Bastard! _B_  How did that happen?!!  Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?  What?!!   Sure! Okay, you go first.  You dont understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, Im not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?  Maybe its not as bad as I think. Yknow, maybe they didnt take it the way I meant it.  Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. Ive been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no ones even looked up from their desk. Hang-hang on.  Hey everybody! Uh, Im gonna kill myself!  Ill get back to ya.  I got nothing. Wait.  Uh, hey Marge!   Ehh, nothing. Nothing. _B_  But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!   How does it feel knowing youre never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing youre gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.  Ah, well if you dont clear this off, you wont be getting one of those from me. But Bens coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this cant be there.  Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?  Do you have any question for Erica?  I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.  That was 14 hours ago.  Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?  Welcome to our side of the tunnel.  Oh my God!!  Yeah.  Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!  Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.    You think?    What?!  Chandler, will you just come in already?  Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?  Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.  Well, I did not know that. Commercial Break _B_  Really?!  Wow! I cant believe I actually rolled an eight.  Okay, Ill rest. But yknow if Im going to bed, then youre coming with me.  Hey, you dont even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!   Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. Im calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available   Ohh, its been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.  No, there is no way! It can not be Ross!  Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!  Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.   Thats a good one.   What?  Oh yeah, I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier. _B_  Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?  Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.  I really made you think about that thing uh?  Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.  Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.  I miss Rose.  Oh, now it's a spare room?  Hey!   ....and 12, 22, 18, four...  What?  We use it!!  Ohh!!   Rachel, could I see you for a moment?    Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!  Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.  Ahhhhhhhhhh , and lower it a couple of inches, so that the fingers are pointing at your wrist. Now take your arms and keeping the elbows bent and your hands in front of you spread out your arms, kinda like making a bird's wing. Now hunch your shoulders over and move you hands up and down as if you are trying to tell some one to turn it down. That's Ross 'quiet down' maneuver. Well, there is an accompanying face, but I don't want to try and describe it as well.)  Actually, I did!  See now-now youre taking them away from their home.   Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and Ill have my health insurance back in no time.  Okay!   I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?  Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybodys allowed one mistake, right? _B_  Chandler! Hes seven Well, we haven't officially asked them yet, but, we would want Monica and Chandler.  Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.  Well, you lied again!   Yes, our system assures total anonymity. We’re very proud of it.  And about an hour ago, we made an offer.   Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good.  Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.  Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?  Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'?  Hey pal.  Night-night Bing-a-ling.  How did you know?  Woooo hoooo!!!  Ahhhh!!  Thats not what I said. Okay, I just meant...  Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter.  Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!  All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! Its not like hes Chandler!  Yeah, well that's how mad I am!! Commercial Break _B_  So Im thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.  Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.  Is everything okay?  Wait a minute. That wasnt a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.   Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what cha doin?  Ha!   Are you saying that you dont wanna get with this?   Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand  Its pretty ugly. We havent seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies.   Paul!  He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! Its not even a song!  Uh, I dont even really know where I left those. Sorry.  Hi!  Okay, dinners ready!  Okay, lets talk about something else.  Awesome! _B_   Answer faster, answer faster!  Oh my god, Emma.

All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.   Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?  Girl No. 1 So uh, you wanna go to Marquel's?  Hey, here she comes.  Well I uh, got what I came for. _B_ I'll uh, I'll see you guys.

Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on.  Wham!  Good one. That was a good one.  Keep at it team.   You promised you would break up with her!  Patrick and I had such a great time last night!

Yeah, thats it-thats it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! Thats-thats what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! Im talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesnt match! Where is it gonna go?!  What?!  Okay.  It's not that bad.   I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.  All right, look Im just gonna unplug it.  Keep going Pinocchio!  Thanks.  You know it's twins, right?  You know it's twins, right?  You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?  Yeah.  Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.  Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.  Ah, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables. MAN ALIVE this thing's fantastic!  What a phony.  Yeah, you do.  In the park?  Why, what happened?   O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.  I dont know, maybe we werent ready to have a chick.  Hey, you're back!  Yeah.  Um-hmm.  Okay.  Chandler? Can I see you for a second?  I wanted it so bad!  Wanna go pack?  Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?   Come on.    Hey there you are!  What are you doing?  And what did he ask you not to call him?  Well, were gonna be layin off people in every department.  Phil!  NOW!!!!!!!!  _B_  Yeah.  Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking about rules and right and wrong and  Oh okay, I see what youre doing there. _B_  Hey dude, what's up?   Answer better, answer better!  Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?  Seriously?  Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...  Ok, that's so nice. _B_  Yeah. I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and. . . why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?  C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!  And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!  Oh, would you let it go already?! Youre fine!   Well, y'know, possibly.  You didnt tell him that, though? Right?  I kinda feel like it's my fault.   Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!  Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!  Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since. But um, I dont think its anything serious.  Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.  Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!  Chandler, Chandler.  I cant believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?  Daddy. All right look, heres the story.  Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy.  So I take off my glasses and thats when it happened. _B_  Oh my God! Joey!  What?! What are you doing?!  Dont you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress like that?  Uh, that-thats-thats me!  Honey you-you got to beat your scores!  You gotta be at least bi...  _B_   No you didn't!   Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?  I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never happened before.  No, no, wait.  His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.  I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never happened before.  Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably. _B_  Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . . _B_  Ben!  Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.  Oh yeah, that's right, look I got us a new goldfish. He's a lot fiestier that the last one.  Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.  Just those two!  What is the worse part?  Hmm.  We never get smacked.  I knew that! Rachel! Use youre head!  How was your conference?  All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?   Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, Im gonna be out with her all night.   Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging bicepsShe knows! Commercial Break _B_   Not really.  Okay.  We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}  I am so attracted to him right now. _B_  Put it back exactly where you found it?  Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...  _B_  Im with you Chandler! I mean I cant have sex with a sick person either, thats disgusting! But Im not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.  All right, heres a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work Im delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine!   I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . _B_ Hi! _B_  Are you okay?  Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone? _B_  Hey, whats going on?  Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying shed like to go out again.  You did? What was he talking about?  Oh! Its okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are.  Did you take that tape?  Connected? I mean...To what? She's a lump!  Wait, wait, wait a minute. If youve just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here? _B_  What does she do there?  Canoodling?  Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.  Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?  Oh yeah, sure, that too.   It does in mine! _B_   Hey!  Okay.  Ooh, y'know we could just do this.   Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.  Hey! So, did you quit?  You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You dont tell the guy that!  Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you  about, cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.  Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!   Uh-huh. Thank Joey!  No way! Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!   Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.  Commercial Break _B_  This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, yknow she had such a terrible childhood.  Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!  Oh-ho-ho, you think I dont know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me!  Well what do you know! Broken! Thatll be $400!  Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.   Green Bay.  All right fine. Fine, Ill do it. Ive just got to get this off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.  Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or-  That's fine, yeah...   Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.  Did you watch the tape?  Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! . Did you hear that?  Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food?  Because I can stop doing that,  I really, really think I can!  From here to the airport?  Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.  Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.  Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!  Which you just gave up really quickly.  Oh, Im sorry honey, Im so, so,  haaaaa! Im so, so sorry, I just  haaaaaa! But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I cant breathe. Can you get me a bag, or something?  Yeah! Why dont you stick around. You can sit right there.   Who wants to make some long distance calls? _B_  Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?  No, the quiet down thing!  All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.   Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.  Yeah?  'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!  Soon! I-I just couldnt before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldnt do that to her, shes my best friend!  Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.   I think hes stoned again.  I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.   You realize what you are dont you?  And what?! Did you sleep with her?!  Yeah. Im okay. Im actuallyIm a little cold, can I have your jacket?  Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!  Chandler!  Chandler! I just figured out who you are!  Are you okay?   Hey!  So is that a bedroom?   Bing! Were all set for tonight, 8 oclock.   That was a long night.  so Ive been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things.  All right, dont freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How long before you have to leave?  Youve got to be kidding me! Commercial Break _B_  I don't know. Who'm I'm married to?  She did WHAT?  I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so...  Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!   Yeah!   Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.  Janice? You called Janice?   Oh God!   Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, hes actually going to kill you dead.  You bug me. _B_  ...Chandler!  Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it!  You never see Joanna again!  All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.   Thanks Rach.   Gunther, can I get a coffee  to go?  No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?  Whoa!! Now look, dont be just blurtin stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?  This sucks man! The last night youre here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.  Okay, you ready to open yours?  Oh my God Chandler! I cant believe it!  Nooo! No, thats not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked my world!   Awwwww    Hey Chandler!  Why don't you just take it with you?  I know, right?  Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?  I hear ya.  Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!  I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.  Ah-ah-ah, you know what that is?  Yeah Bing, what's that about?  Whats the matter?  The receipt.  I think so.  Is there any chance you didnt see that? Commercial Break _B_   Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?  Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?  Yeah, when were in the audience he doesnt talk to us, but he does wave. _B_  Yay! Emily!   All right, so what do you say?  Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?  So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!  Im not your best friend?  Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?  Hello, funny Valentine.  What?!! Thats even worse!!  Hey!   Are you sure youre okay?  Wait, but theres no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!  Youre Lewis Posin.   What?  Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani!   All right, whenever youre ready.   Oh, my ex-wife didnt work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.  Okay, he was talking about rules.  Excuse me?  I cant help you.  You liked it? You really liked it?  She hot?  I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.  I guess you're right.  I-I-I don't know.  Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.  You remember Janice, right?  OK, let's go.  Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . .  Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.  Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!  Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.  You never come into this office again!  Oh, umm, I was just yknow working out and umm Oh, thats it.  You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?   I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.  Oh dont listen to him, hes just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I dont think hes gonna get it.  Nah, not my game.  The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.  Okay.   All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?  What?  You gave my father a lap dance!  What?!  Listen, sorry I didnt stop by last night but I had a date.  You too!  Why don't you just call her?  Seriously? She actually said that?  *What*'   You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?   Can I talk to you alone for a minute?  Pass it! Pass it!  What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.   Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.  Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.  I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, shed say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!  Nope.   Hey!  Hey!  Oh, just do it!!  All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.  All right, all right, at least Im prepared.  Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.  Okay, I think I might know why my parents dont like you.  I dont know! But its the same!  Ohh thats sweet!  Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?  Whats-whats going on? Phils really pissed!  But audiencesYou have a live studio audience and they must love that. They must love it when they see you guys playing. _B_  Oh? Why not?  Umm, and looking at people differently.  All right, all right, well just do our best. Okay? So lets say Im the interviewer and Im meeting you for the first time. Okay. "Hi! Come on in, Im uh, Regina Philange."  Which part exactly?  How did she get me to settle down?  Whats going on?  ...that center around work.  Twins actually run in my family.  Twins actually run in my family.   Helloo!!  Alright, here, you have to hold this. _B_  I guess we just keep dancing. _B_  Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.  No, I stuff outside the bra.  All right!!  You give me back my Walkman!  Hey! Youre wearing pants!  Okay.   Well Judy, you did it! She's finally full! Commercial Break _B_  What?!   Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.  Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.  Well, whats it called?  No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.  Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?  No, yknow what? Its gonna be okay. I mean you dont have to have this rustic Italian feast. Yknow? And-and you dont need, you dont need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.   Cause otherwise theyd have to call it the room room.  Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home. _B_  Okay. Okay, Im ready. Come on big fella!  Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!  Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!  Im waiting.   Do you?  Alright you guys, we can’t turn on each other, Okay? That’s just what she wants.  Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!  Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.  Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!  Interesting!  Can I see you for a second?   Interesting!  Can I see you for a second?   So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.  Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!   They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.  Well that's how I feel.  Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.  Thank you!    Hes retiling my floor.   Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, Ill let you have her.  Hey, its been like three weeks!  No. Im-Im to depressed to talk.  Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.  Aww man! I cant believe I locked myself out again!   She said, "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she said, "Thank you."  Come on man, you know Id do it for you! Because, youre my best friend.  Oh, it was awful.  I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.  And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!   Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?   Hey!  Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.  Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.  Over the line?! You-youre-youre so far past the line, that you-you cant even see the line! The line is a dot to you! _B_  Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.  Rachel?   Oh my God!  No! But because he thought I was too faaaaa .  And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Yknow, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.  Maybe that will liven up this party.  Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!  Whats going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?  What did he tell you?  Bing, what an unusual name.  Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.  Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!  Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe...  Oh honey...  That's a good point.  Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!  Commercial Break _B_  Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.  Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.  Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!  Its 930 in the morning!  Well, I do.   Hey! Ross and  I dont know how to play Cups.  Oh, shes uh-uh really sick.  Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See thats what this is about.  Come on, its not that big a deal!  Hey! Good, youre home!  Give me the good stuff.  Yeah!  Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!   How come you have two?  Don't you have to pee?  Hey.  Without that, you just got "lame with women".  if a girl says yes to being taped... She doesn't say no to much else, I tell ya...   Oh Chandler, stop talking!  What do you mean "what do we do"?  What do you mean "what do we do"?  Hey, it's everybody.  Well then maybe I will.  Joseph's good, isn't he?  He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!  Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.  Well I dont like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Dont feel bad man, we all have our strengths. Youre better with numbers and stuff.  Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?  No, no, no, thats Dina.  These little women. Wow!   Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.  Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, Im gonna kill myself, I swear. I cant, I cant watch this.  Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, shes going in.  Aww, man, now we wont be bank buddies!   Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?  Viva Las Gaygas!  Chandler!    Uh fellas,   Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?   These arent for you! Are you upset?   Hi!  I dont know, aheh, yours was the first name that-that popped into my head, Im Im sorry. I-I didnt think it would matter.  Name one! _B_   Okay. Chandler, did your dad ever hug you?  Oh my God, Richard.   No, I know. But yknow what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.   Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?   Oh my God! That is so good!  So why cant the three of us go out together?  Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.  Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, Ive got a great little villa you can stay at.  Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?  Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.  Thanks.....   I'm gonna take off now. You're gonna let me go home, aren't you?  What's going on?   Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you.   Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later.    It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied.  Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it. _B_  Ok. _B_  What's this.  Does it hurt?  Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything.  Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!    So, did you do it?  Hello.  Oh, hey Ross!  Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?  Well, I was gonna let you play with it. _B_  All right.  Its kind of embarrassing, yknow. I mean, I was an actor and now Im a waiter. Its supposed to go in the other direction.   My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I cant breathe.  No! No, she doesnt. Uh Phoebe, what she makesthats uhtheyre sock rabbits. They are completely differentOkay! Okay! Okay! I didnt make it! Im sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that were supposed to make the presents!  How? I dont have any money.  Hey baby.   Two days ago.  No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batmans tux!  Get out.   What? Whoo... What?  I dont know what to say. We shouldnt have lied to you.  Okay.  Hey!  Chandler, you're panicking!  Chandler, you're panicking!  Yes, I am.  Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line,  you know that's bad for the paper tray.  Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.  Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to...   Well you sure used a large font.  We didnt fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!  Shes going in. Wait! Hes going in! Hes going in!! The doors closed! I, I cant see anything but the door closed!!  Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.  Why?  Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.  I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.  So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!   Hey roomie!  Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.  How was I supposed to know wed end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?   Awww, man! He promised he wouldnt take the chairs!!  No! No! Its just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.  Listen, Im sure that dad doesnt care. He probably thought this was funny; hell be telling this story for years!  Anyway, I started working on what Im going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?  Good God Bing I well I cant say Im altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. And the way she looked at me, pure lust.  Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!  You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didnt take any of my suggestions! Thats for coming buddy. Ill see you later.   Oh I’m kinda part of this.  No, no, I should get home, I'm kinda tired.  I proposed to Chandler!  Alright, moving on...  No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.  Oh, okay.  _B_  Who is being loud?  Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.  Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?  The balloon?  Uh-oh, it was bad?  Oh-oh, my God!  Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So  Umm, cups.  Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?  Damn!  A two and a five.  No-no, its not okay! Its not! I mean you were just Youre so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Yknow Im just gonnaI, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here , and I am going to do anything you want in there!    Monica! Chandler!  How much?  I made you a surprise.   Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me! Joey and  Thats right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film that Batman film he was in.  Id move in tomorrow!  Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.  All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame...   You could go to the game with me, even though I know you said you couldnt, but then you lied to me, tricked me and gave me a bump on the head.  Okay!  Thank you?   Okay, André should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye.  Just easier that way.  You guys ready to go?  Oh!  We can't split them up!  We can't split them up!  Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now.   I used to be Bryce on All My Children. _B_ _B_  Hey-hey-hey thats funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!  That was me.  But Jos got a crush on Laurie.  Oh. You mean its like a girl-girl thing? Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.  Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!  Would you stop? Weve only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we dont even know if hes gonna propose.  Well, youre amazing.  Then you go to Tokyo.  Okay!  300 dollars?!  I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."  It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.  Bye.   Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?   Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.  Commercial Break _B_  Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didnt think big enough to fit a grown man!  Hey Chandler?   Hey.  Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.  Bing my boy, were gonna get you over this. Now heres the plan, grab your coat, were going to a strip club.  And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!  No, they look too weird.   No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.  What's going on?  G-gift? The thing's not the gift?  Eddie.   Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.  Oh, you got the whole night, huh?  When she sees that youre gone, shes gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and Im gonna get fired!  I can't, I gotta go.   Shh!!  Wait, what?  Yknow it doesnt matter how much Im craving it. Yknow why Im never gonna eat meat? Because its murder, cold blooded murder.   I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.  What?!  Hey! You ready to go?  I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room! _B_  Really?!  Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you  were trying to get Ross stoned!  Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story Ive had such a craving for them.  Oh its umm, its tofu cake. Do you want some?   Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so  "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share."  Eh?  "It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving."  "We too can share and love and have and receive."  So?  Im so sorry.  Okay what’s up  Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game.  Merry Christmas.  Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?  No, forget it.  Ok.   Dude! You're not taking your Bible?  Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?  Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?  Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.  Aaahhhhhhh!

You barely know her!   A TV as if it appears from nowhere! Thats the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?  Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree  like that.  You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.  Okay.   It is not over! Youre over!  All right, how about the ladybugs?  Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.  Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?    Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?  No-no, she really is sick!  Well its hard to tell  Oh God, if she would just stop moving.  Oops!  Yknow, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?  I was tryin to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what Im gonna do?  Would you .Would you hug me?  You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!   Its unbelievable! I-I cant believe that sign didnt work!  Oh great! Were going out again Saturday. But I just found shes also seeing some other guy.  Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry. _B_  Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit em. I cant wait. Theyre going to be crying so hard. Theyre going to be fighting for breath.  Spend more time with the tie. That'll make a baby.  Ok, how bout this. If you guys die, and the crazy plate lady dies...THEN do I get the baby.  You can go.  You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me  I have a date.  See?  ALL eyes on ME! _B_  You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?  What a small world!  I don't think so.  Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.  Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. _B_ Where's the mail?  Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?  Hey!  Chandler!!   No! Joey, we swore wed never tell!  No, theres nothing to make up, shes gonna know that I have a key to her office, Ive got to get you locked up back the way you were!   You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!  Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.  A four and a nine.  Ross, I cant believe youd do that!  BEND OVER?!!! _B_   Hey!  Huh? Uh   No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.   Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello!

Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!  No he's not!  Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!  Well, apparently not, and I cant just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!  Yeah, the phone was facing the other way.  And that goes back up there. Commercial Break _B_  Now are drawers will smell nice and we didnt waste these pantyhose.  See, now its weird again.  We have got to wash that!   ...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...   Thats exactly what my dad used to say!   Well, my nose got lonely.  Really?  You were trying to eat it!   Hmm?   So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera. _B_ It kept rolling and recorded everything.   Hey Mona!  Marcel?  Oh sure, now you're Mister Sensitivity. But when you wantedto have sex right after my uncle's funeral  Well, actually....  You should go to the game. Its okay, I want you to.   Blah blargah, blar-blab.  _B_  Why not?  You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.  You don't keep it over here on this table any more?  What the hells the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.  All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.  I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...  No. Why?  Honey, having a heart attack is natures way of telling you to slow it down.  Hi, Joey.  Well well, look what you brought.  Oh!  Sorry. Uh, Ive got those plans with Phoebe, why?  Well you shouldnt be. Believe me I wouldnt want to be the guy whos up against you.  I mean that doofus is going to lose!  Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.  Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?  What? Who says that?  Okay...   No.  They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?  Bert and Ernie!  Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin! . So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna have a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie   That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire cast of "Eight is Enough" comes out of there! We are taking them home, because they are our children!  That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire cast of "Eight is Enough" comes out of there! We are taking them home, because they are our children!  All of us.  Hey man, check it out, I got some great stuff to dehydrate here. I got some grapes, got some apricots, I thought it would be really cool to see what happens with these water balloons.

Stung bad. I couldnt stand. I-I couldnt walk.  Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when Im doing something exciting and I dont wanna get too excited, I just ahh, yknow try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!  Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, Im gonna do that.  Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones.  You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!  Oh, are we gonna trash that place?   What?!   Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.  Hey Chandler.  Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!   Okay-okay! Two very good points, look Ive known you both a long time, and Ive never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?   Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year. _B_  Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.  Wait, were supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.  Well uh, she didnt want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. Im so sorry.  I brought you something.  Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?  Five more seconds.  Hi, Im Lisa.  Seriously?   Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.   Come on.  Hello?  Im sorry you have the wrong number.   Okay, Ill call you later dad. I love you.  _B_  Oh, nothin much. Just trying to figure out what Im gonna do for dinner.  But they like it!  Now that youre a couple, we dont get two presents from you guys?  Hi!  Marcel?  Woman No. 1 Hi, can I help you?   All right.  _B_  No, you're right. Mnya, we shouldn't do it like this. Huch.For what it's worth, I'm, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come down onyou so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not theend of the world.  Er...it's just that in THAT case...then erm...Emma would go to my parents.  Yeah, itll be fine. Yknow, maybe Ill stay and practice the art of seduction.  Ah. Fun conversation?  God works in mysterious ways.   Okay. Shhh...    Okay. Shhh...   Alright, here you go my friend. Eggs a-la Eddie, huh?  All right, thats it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.   Hey! I got great news!   Hi!   We were just talking about you.  150 dollars.  Theyre in Vermont!! How could this happen?!   Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...  Hey!  She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.  You're not going to believe this!  What?! Tonight?!  Kristen Lang.  When I got married you slept with my sister.  You just stay here!   What’s going on?  No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.  Why? What did you do in the bathroom?  Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.  No, actually, we're buying the house next door.   What?  Come on!!   What am I going to do?  People need juice!  No-no-no, I think Im gonna see how things go with Kathy. Shes pretty cool.  Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!  Let me see that.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot my paper.  _B_  Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.  Love is the best medicine.  Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides its getting darker and more painful, that means its healing.  Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.  You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. Youre right, Im sorry.  I had them made special.  Hey sweetie!  I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!  Janice?   Oh, Im sorry.  Lisa,  Monica, Chandler. We used to date.  Ah, yeah!   HeyOoh! Whats-whats that, dinner stuff?

Umm, actually Im just a nurse.  A monkey.  Thats right. _B_  Yah.  Huh? Really? -- Hm, that'd be so terrible?   Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two  like that?  But she liked us.  Okay!  Okay!  Huh.  Oh, can I borrow this?  My milks gone bad.  And I was tired from digging the huge hole!  Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.  So you were right?  Howhow did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!   Hey!  My God, Joey!  No.   What?!!  What?  Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.   Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.  Well I didn’t! I didn’t propose!  Unless uh…  Did I? I haven’t slept in forty hours and…it does sound like something I would do. Commercial Break _B_  Excuse me?  Er... Who has to die for me to get her? _B_  Thanks, heres ya ticket.  This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.  _B_  No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.  You, you want, you want me to move out?  Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.  I don't know you guys.  Juice, I need...   Right in there! _B_  No-no, Kathy.  No! I balanced my checkbook.   Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry  Its kind of an important one!  Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.  Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.  For 99 cents, I'd eat you.  Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look!  Oh! Look! Hi!  Why do you do it?  Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.  Yeah. Go over to Joeys. Go over to Joeys and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.  That's fine.   Chicken Soup for the Soul?  Oop, your cake is ready!  Oh.... my.... God. _B_  Whoa-whoa-hey-hey!  Hi, Paul is it?   Chandler, wh-why dont we sit down?   No, I know! I get it! Its funny!  Um-hmm, thats good to know. But lets stop focusing on what you dont do, and start focusing on what you do do.  D'you want to?  We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...  Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor.   Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it!  Ellen, we're going to talk numbers.    Gimme the bottle.  Gimme the towel.  _B_  No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me.  So umm, how was your date with Ginger?   Sure. Ill help you.  Well, so, why dont you just turn it off?  You really think so?  Hey!  Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!  Oop!   Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didnt want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that shes going to Florida for spring vacation.  And again, and again, and again...  Hello?  And again.  This is the most special day of our lives.  Oh. Then, no.  Woman No. 2 Did I put too much rum in here?  Woman No. 1 Just a sec.  Hope you find your monkey.   What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?  Oh, I still can’t believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn’t make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!   Tulsa, Oklahoma!  Okay. 1 Yeah, I'm sure.  I uh, I gotta tell you man, I mean, that's uh, it's kinda out of the blue, I mean don't you think?  Its beautiful! Its like the first bathroom floor there ever was.  Whoa! Are you going in there for?  And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'  Yeah, okay.   Hey!  All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig!  Oink! _B_  No. No, Kathy.  What?  You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?  We are the hottest! Huh?

Because I know that this isn't the end.  Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.   Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor?  Yeah, I miss you too.  Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know?  Well, that's very generous  er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about....  And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier?  Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection!  No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy!  I'll see you on Monday!  _B_  Yes, its in my In in my pocket.   My back pocket! My back pocket!  Bye Chandler!   I miss you already.   Are you saying that you dont want to get with this?  Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.  I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.  Yeah! He's lying he looked down!   I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet.  C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.  Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.   Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.  Yeah.   He's here.  I'm assuming one of you is the father.  Well you guys, I'm outta here. See ya pals.  There's a game?  Sounds like shes got the ah, whole package.  So what if he didnt come! We can still go out and party ourselves!   Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.  Stop saying that. I hate that. _B_  Hi!  Thanks, Chandler.    So the Porsche guy took his car back.  Hey Chandler. Come on in. Were knitting pot holders.  I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, dont-dont be mad. Im sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Yknow? And it was our first date! Plus, shes really sick!  No way! I've been going to the guy for 12 years.  Honey, umm I-I love you,  but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay?  Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, were only gonna get married once.  I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why dont you tell about your lovely wedding?  Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?  Id like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldnt that be nice?  What?  Chandler, I don’t even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!  Thanks, man. _B_ Where ya going?  You are to me...   That is so sweet. I love you.   Here she comes!  Here she comes!  So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh? Commercial Break _B_  Ohhhh.

Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?  Any luck?  Yknow what I think? I think somebodys got a little crush on Casey. How bout I fix you two up? What do you think?  So! Ross doesnt really decorate his tree with floss, but you dont hear him complaining do you? God!   Wow! If only more people knew. _B_  Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?!  _B_  No, you're the best.  Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.  God, its gonna so weird like when I come home and youre not here. Yknow? No more Joey and Chans. No more J and Cs. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandlers?" "Cant, its not there."  Whats going on?  No thanks, Josephine. _B_  No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.  Oh thats so sweet! Look Chandler I dont care if you cant cry, I love you.   Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.  Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.  Oh.

Joey and Rachel's apartment. Chandler and Rachel are talking.]   Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.   Okay, Okay,  All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house.  How long do you want the cuffs?  Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it.  You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.  I'm him.  So how you two gettin' along?  Uh-huh.  Chandler?  Well if you go to Disneyland, you dont spend the whole day on the Materhorn.  Are you sure?  I dont get this! She was horrible!   Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."  _B_  What? Chandler! Tell 'em!  That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.  Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.  I know, but dont you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?  What?  You-youre gonna have to put your foot down?  Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy!  He brought Twizlers! Commercial Break _B_  We can't, alright?  We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.   How long has it been this time?  Are you okay? Youve been acting weird all afternoon.  We are pretty good.  Are you trying to tell me that we’re moving to Oklahoma, or that you’re gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?  So? I'm married.   It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!   Adoption.  Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!    Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why dont you ask Chandler, cause hes the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin over Janice by groping my sister.  You guys!! Come on!  I want you to met some friends of mine.  This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we dont do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say lets Ross it!  We were just waxing our legs.  Thats right I stepped up! Shes my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, Id pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldnt. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.  It's 430.  All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.  I wasnt sleeping.  Oh please. Every moment is precious. Yknow? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends dont really seem to care too much that youre leaving.  I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!   You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.  Wow! I could've died tonight.  Yeah but we wont be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.  Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?  Stop it!  Oh! You have a window!   You told her!  Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us! _B_  Yes!  Okay, dont worry. Youre ready.  It wasn’t fun?!  But you are a liar.  I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?  Okay, you come up with an idea.  I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best.  I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.  Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy!  You guys are so pathetic, I, oh, OH, XANADU! OH.  Great, well, I'm happy for ya. _B_ Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice.  After!!   Morning.  Beefsteak Charlies?  Oh this, well Im glad you asked.

All right!   He took my snack!  Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have the car! Right?  Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh"  Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.  I went to Egypt with my dad.  Chandler, I found the perfect ring.   Regina Philange.   Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?  Marcel?  Thats better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it except all I did was think about it.  Jeez! What is with you?  Well maybe Im ready now. I mean, its a little scary, but maybe its right.  Thank you.  No, you're all about the fun.   Oh. What's *that* like?  I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.  What do you think?  He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.  Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU.  Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?  I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask... _B_  Really? Thats great! You and my sister, sittin in a tree.  For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.  Okay, I see what's going on here.  Aw, honey, that's so sweet.  On no! No! Its not good-bye, Im not leaving until you get on that plane.  Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh...  I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.   God, your hair sure is different!  Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots. _B_  I do have a newfound respect for life.   Hi.  Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.  You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.   I wont care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.   Joey that is so sweet.   Oh look! That guy's peeing!  See? Thats a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera.  Youre changing it!  Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? Cause Carol threw it out, she lost ours. Shes such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass. _B_  Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and youll be great.  Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you. _B_  Hi, glad you could come.  You still here?   Please.. please, we are so close.  But we love our house.  Yeah I guess you're right.  Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.  Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.   No, thank you.  Chandler!   Heard about the leg burnin huh?  Oh!   No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".  Hi, Rach.  Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.  They uh director. Uhh, her.  All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.  Okay! Oh God, yknow what? Its really bad.  Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.  Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.  I said name one! Commercial Break _B_  Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. Its over!   Hey. Ross and  People have got to finish their stories! Commercial Break _B_  I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.  Im sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green. _B_  Then why do you throw like one?  Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why dont we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?  All right, whats going on?  What?!!  Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa. _B_  No...you both are equally capable. It's just that you're strongest, when you're together.  Seriously? Happily married. So that phone call before, that was ... happy?  So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?  You told him he's adopted?  Ooh, this is it, 74. _B_  Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.   Thank you.  Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?  Cool! Ill catch up!  Commercial Break _B_  Yeah! You don't like Kathy.  Oh, yknow, would you just for once, not remember every little thing!!   One ticket to Yemen?  Okay.  Four.  I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-  Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.    Oh?  Hello you.  Paolo made a pass at me.  _B_  Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you dont cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it wont matter to me.  Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?   OK.   How could you tell her?!  All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?  I cant believe you. You still havent told that girl she doesnt have a job yet?  Yeah! I didnt know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise!  You know what? Let's not talk.  What are you doing?  Hi, you're Chandler Bing, right? I'm Tom Gordon, I was in your class.  Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok? First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying...  Stop lying!   okay, right.   Oooohh that’s interesting.  Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body.   I'm gonna do it.   Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth.  Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?  What are you doing here?  Oh yeah, come here.    Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!    Now, well see.  Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.  This doesnt mean anything, does it?  So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.  Im gonna call her.  Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There arent any message youve forgotten to give me are there?  Apparently youre not very good at it! I  This is great!  Helen, could you come in here for a moment?   Some guy bought it. Im sorry. I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail!   Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!   Wait! Wait! Maybe shes a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what shes supposed to do.  Sure. "Monica."  Okay.   Chandler, you dont believe in soul mates?   In what John Houston film would you hear this line, "Badges? We dont need no stinkin badges!"  So were gonna try? I mean, are we trying?  What?   Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!  But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?  Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh.  _B_ Hard to say. _B_   Oh my God, I'm late.   Well, now we got a reason.  Huh?  Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?  A couple of days.  Im sorry sir, I dont understand.  Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.  Hi, Chandler.  I know.   Eh?  I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.  I wanna say good-bye at the car!  Come on! What are you doing?! Im in character! Would you talk to her!   Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.  And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And youre writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still cant shed one tiny tear, I know youll be crying a river inside.  You couldnt do it?!  Thank you Helen, that'll be all.   Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.  Okay, firstfirst of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up.  See? All right, now you try. Look down , youre looking down, keep looking down  Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument.  Uh, would you take one of us?  Oh no, we cant walk!   I cant believe that you yelled at my boss! Im-Im gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!  Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.  I lie better than that right?   She's asleep.  Thanks... uh... I'm so sorry about Ross, it's...  No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.   Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?   Dah!!   That saves us a conversation.  Yeah.  Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.  Are you being British?!  Our place, the hall! I...  Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.  Look, we are not gonna   Oh yeah! You'rehey, you're right!

Yeah, she didnt cry. She wasnt angry or sad.   Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!  The little jail between the doors!  Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But, see, they don't know that we know that they know! So  Pivot! Piv-at! Piv-at!!  What about my questions?  Really? Thats the thing Im worse at! Youll see.  _B_  Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now.  Wow, you sure found that quick.  I justI wish I didnt feel this way about Rachel anymore, yknow? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think I think Ross feels left out. Yknow? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God You shouldve seen the look on Rosss face.  By the way, I have no idea what Im doing here. For all I know Im just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?  Oh, thank God!  I dont believe in soul mates either.  Correct! Theres a possible backwards bonus!  Okay, hold on a sec.  You fell asleep?  if what you and your wife have is so great, then why are you spending Christmas with me?  _B_ _B_  I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!  Yeah. Mine too.  Come on.  this summer?  Thank you. _B_  Okay.

Lets go!  What are you doing?! Chandler! You cant just go back a phase!  Are you travelling with a child?  No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.  Okay. Okay.  Ace!   What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress?   Really?  They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.  What is wrong with you?!!!  Hi, honey.  Maybe Monicas playing a joke on ya. Yknow? Getting her own husband a hooker, thats pretty funny.  Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?  Oh, blablablabaybaybay.  Who is he?  right now, somewhere out there  our baby could be being conceived.  Ahh!  OK, here I go. I'm goin' in.  Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood.

But yknow, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.  Well, Chandler and I are in a bar  Hey. Rachel and  Oh, Im sorry. Was that another joke?  Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.  Yeah.  No. I dont think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.  Yes!  Yeah.  Chandler, I…  Hey...there you are. You disappeared after dinner.  Really?  Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!  Closing credits_B_  And listen to this...    And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape! .   Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.  Okay. Oh no, I have to.

And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case  Okay  What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!  Hey!  Hey.   I cant walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!  Hey! Sleeping beauty!  Well you gotta get at it princess! When your mother and I were trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. That’s how I got my bad hip.  I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you saidyou wouldn't have sex with me while we're fighting.  Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.

It is when were able to crack each other up. _B_  Why wont you take our picture?  Because I put my head between her legs.  Do you mind if I smoke in here?  Oh, I just I feel terrible.  Oh, my God.  No, Ive had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?  Wise choice, how many rungs?  Well, we could start trying. Now.  Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about! I mean it's not like they're so responsible. Emma as a product of a bottle of Murlo and a five-year-old condom.  Well, not anymore.   Hey Chandler.  Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.  Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?   I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.  Baywatch.   Quick, take off your dress, he wont notice the bed.  Oh my God, is she going back to him?  What?  Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, shes very private about her office. Now I know why.   Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?  You idiot!!  On account of my rage.  No.  Dude! How come you took off?   You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.  Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...   Youre drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe Im a little drunk.   Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! Theyre killing me! One toe at a time!  Poor Ross.    Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?  That's right, I got mine.  So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?  It's worse than the thumb!  Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really.  Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place.  No, he's gone.  No no, you don't have to fly back, really.  What do you mean this might be your only chance?  Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.   Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie...  Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.  You got a better idea?  _B_ Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.  Where is this party?  Yeah...  Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!  I know-  Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.  _B_  Yeah, it's good.  But no, because a doctor wont be able to help him, its just gonna yknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years.  That cant be your father.  Uh, your finger was covering the lens.  Theyre my pants!  I know.  Really? Me? Wow! I dont even know any huge gay people! _B_   That noise can only me one thing.  No, not here. Maybe here.  "Circle or hoop".  No....You learn these things. You grow into it.  I know, I just thought it would be fun.  No you didn't.  Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.  No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....  It's not Rick.  Lifeguards.  Its Monicas bed. What?  What are you ah, what are you gonna do?  What if I clean your bathroom for a month?  Does Joey know?  Yeah.  You dont tell a guy that youre looking for a serious relationship! You dont tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!  Okay!  Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell mejust say, "I don't like your massages."  Is something wrong?   Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!  Noo! But that would've been so cool!  Then keep running.  _B_  Oh Mon, I laughed so hard  Santa!    Hey! Are those crab cakes?  Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?  How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?  Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? Its here.  Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? Youve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?  Oh, why is it unfair?  What? You... You... Oh! Can I ask you a personal question? Ho-how do you shave your beard so close?  Stegosaurus!  Oh, just had a baby.  Uh huh. Why is that?  Heads.  No.  Who's party is it?  Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. Hows it going. This is the hardest letter Ive ever had to write.  What the hells a matter with you? How do you think Joeys going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?  Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?  Well I assume the ah, happy couple isnt up yet. Did you guys hear them last night?   Awww, man! He promised he wouldnt take the chairs!!  Yknow you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!  Who cares? You're Rachel!  Who's Kip?  Dude!  Chandler!  Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.  Im pretty sure its gun.  Ah whatever! _B_  Oh please, he didnt hear it! He didnt hear it!!  Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?  What?  No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.  I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad. At the fun parts and at the hard parts.  Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.  No you did.  Do you hear something?   So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?  'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.  Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?  What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?  No, it's-it's Andrew.  Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.   So. This has always been Monicas bed, what youre just noticing now, how self-involved are you?  Well, it doesnt matter what I would do.  Foot rubs for a month!  Yknow, you should never be allowed to talk to people!  Me neither, y'know what-  Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.   I didn't finish my five pages.   See? It's no big deal.  Okay.  That's right baby.  It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?  I thought it was Chandler!  Well, what did you have?  What are you doing here, Santa?  Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first.  Ah Ooh Oohh Ohh Oh God Ohh Oh Ohh Ohhhh  Give me a number, I dont want to owe you anything!  But pleasure is important,  and it helps if the woman has an orgasm. You up to the task sailor?   Hey, you know our phone's not working?  Why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it?   Hey, listen. Call me.  No, I'll do it.   You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.  Yes! Whew!  No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.  What woman?!  All right, look, look, youve got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.  Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didnt think big enough to fit a grown man!  No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just wouldve just stepped aside.  Uh-huh, not as high as  It worked! King!  Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?  Go on, teach me something about men and women.  Yknow uh, actually I-I-I should get going.  Hey well, you cant teach someone to be good with women. Yknow, thats why I never had any luck with Chandler.  I really wish that you wouldnt.   I can do an English accent?! That babys going on my résumé! _B_   For Im loved by a pretty wonderful boy!  Hello! And welcome to the show. I see some of our regulars in the audience. And a couple of irregulars.   You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?  Fine.  Shes wearing my bra!  Why? You saw it? Is it scary?   Oh.  Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me-give me a second!  Can you hear me say you're grounded?  Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... Ok, goodbye.   Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!  Everyday use.  Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.  Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.  Nooo!  He's... new.  They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?  All right, youre probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me,  I would ah, I would bow out.  Ill take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!  Oh! See just Im right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!   I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.  Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.  That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!   No-no! Don't do it! Don't!  You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.  You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!  Uh,  wow, 700.  Well, yknow what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think Im just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.  Thats not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow Im not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys.  Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.   And shes back in the game. _B_  I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?  I couldn't even if I wanted to. _B_  Sure.  _B_  Oh Bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. Let me buy you a lap dance with those girls. Huh?  Ah-ah-ah! Were doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those?  I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.  Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?   Y'know what's weird?  Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.  Oh, thank you.   Hi  Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.  Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.  Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?   Where in Cuba? _B_   Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something. Closing Credits _B_  Okay, well be right in.  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?  I was tryin to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what Im gonna do?  Chandler-  Oh my God!   Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.  No way!  Hey! Look who I found!  Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I dont feel that way about you.   Speech! Speech! Lets hear from the birthday girl! Huh?  Do you want some shortbread? Eh thats Scottish like you are.  Yes!  My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!  I look like a man'  It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list.   Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!  Guest.  What is with you?  I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.  And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't. _B_  What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.  Yeah?  No, that's not exactly what I was..  No, no, no, dont get up, I got a cooler right here. _B_  The Geller Cup.  Hello.  He loves you.  Really?   My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages. 8 Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.  Yeah.  Yeah! Thats why Im sleeping with him on the side.  I cant believe her, yknow its justits so typical.  Hey! No-no-no-no, you cant take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!  Hello Skidmark.  Did you bring me any presents, Santa?  Really?! Commercial Break _B_  She's bluffing!  Thats funny. Yeah. Yknow youre the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.  BingWhats this?!   Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?  Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.  This doesn't feel weird!  No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.  Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.  Tell me about it.  Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza-  Hey, that's not for you, bitch!  _B_  Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?  Hey, Chandler.   Fights over!  _B_   WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!  No! God, would you just calm down!   Okay.  I dont know!  Well that's pathetic!  Oh yeah, that's right!  Yknow, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.  Im sorry Chandler, yknow you are such a sweet guy and I, I dont want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.  What?!  Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?  Heres the plan! Okay? Im going to leave you get a look at Brendas bra!  Id like to spin the wheel!   Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?  It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!   Oh! Great! So how much does it pay?  _B_  Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Oh...    Hey, what's goin' on?   Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.  No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.  Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.  Okay, okay, I'll go first.  So what do you want?  Hey.  Yeah.  Your thinking about my leg arent you?  No.  Im not proving anything. Okay, Im done listening to you. If I hadnt let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never wouldve put my fist through the wall!  Dude, I am sorry about what I said!  Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out. _B_  Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.  Oh my God! You don't know me at all!  All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!  I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!  I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.  What?  Oh Ross, calm down, Ill give you the 80 cents.  _B_  And hey! Just so you know, its not that common! It doesnt happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!  Paris?  Its pretty clear.  Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.   Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question.  No, its a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it. Were gonna go to the East River right now and throw it in there!  Shes right of course not. Honey, get the tape.  Okay, so thats another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, thats   Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each other. That's all that matters.  You're a really good kisser.  Rach?!  Rachel!!!!?  So I can't do anything I like'' _B_  Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.  I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.  I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.  All right fine, I pick you.  Thanks, any suggestions?  _B_  You are so the man!  Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, cause my Grandma doesnt know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.  Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.  It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?   Bing! You got those numbers for me?  And Rachel.  And thats Chandler.   There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!  Seriously, good game though. Good game.   What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!  But hey, Ross, this place is available now!  And this goes for all guys?  It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?  Or we could just follow your clever jokes  any ideas? No! Didnt think so! Okay, cmon guys, show us where the presents are!   Chandler!  Of course!   What are you doing?  I would do it but she thinks Im attracted to her!  Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?  Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand... _B_  Karen.  So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....  You have me!   Help yourself.  No-no.  Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.  Its not that bad.  Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.  Oh, none for me. Thanks.  I'm crying here!!  So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight.  Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I knew you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!  Ooh, so close.  Really?  Oh and  Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach  or uh, or saying mmm and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay?  Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?  Im not writing about you! Im writing about other people.  Keep talking.  Thats why you broke up with me?  Where's Chandler?  What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!  No-no I heard! Im just sorry.  Hey Rach. _B_  Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?  Okay.  Ooh, my!  Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!  Please!  Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life!   Hm-hmm!  Honey?  I really do, yeah.  Well, if there is anything else you wanna know...   No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.  Well, I-I mightve said supergay.  Oh! Wow! Hey!   You betcha! _B_  How much it bothers you? because I dont like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time?  Oh!!  You guys knew about this and you didnt tell us?!  I know. That's what I told her.  Oh, you forgot?  I remember you did.  Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie  Here, Ross, take our picture.  Smile! You're on Janice Camera!  Well, I brought the next best thing.  No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.  All right.    Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.  Ohh, Im sorry.  I know, Monica told me.  Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.  Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on were a team! Were in this together!  Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.   Yeah...  Oh, great. More party boys for Chandler!  Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.  Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.  Yeah.  We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.  Why?  Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.  Yes!  Whaddyou mean?  Phoebe moved out.   Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.   Well that sounds fun too.    So, youre just Bing?  'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.  And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.  Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?  Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven?  Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.  I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!  I dunno, there's just something about...  Thats very funny!  That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didnt you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan?  The neighbor's dog. _B_  Its my joke.  Okay, you watch too much TV.  No reason, its just I know a single guy that cares about other people.  Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!  _B_  Wash your hands!!!  Yep. Ice Capades.  Oh-ho, I think its nice.  Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side effects!  007 has a fancy car!  So you think Ross too?   Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says its time to go, its time to go.  _B_  All right, what else?  THAT'S NOT ME!  Wow! You are really fast!  About that? Erm...I'm going to change.  Okay.  No, 19.  Oh, sure. Yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. Captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college.   What?  Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.   Yeah.  Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller.  Thats okay, youre still my number one guy!  Bing!  Hi, Im Karen.  Well, Chandler, youre gonna have to tell him.  Hes doin some thinkin! _B_  Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?   How does that laugh not give you a headache?  Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!  Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.   Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.   Hey!  Its my joke. Ross and  How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.  What?! Anything! Anything!  Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, Ill just write about Phyllis! Hmm!   Bonjour, monsieur.  Yeah. Sure.   Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-youre wrecking it.  How did you know about that?!  Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at womans breasts all the time!  Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.  Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.  Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats y'know, for all your tiaras and stuff.  Why would you kill his fish?  Really?  Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.  ...Like, ...all of them?  I dont understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I dont have a boyfriend?  Whats that?  What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!  All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?   How about you?  So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?  You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?  I know it doesn't make much sense  Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.  Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.  Who cares? I repel women. _B_  Thanks!  Yeah, theres pulp in that.   Okay, dont say anything, you might scare it away.   All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!  007 gets all the ladies.  Ross is really strong! Okay, hes the strongest out of all three of you!  Except for Joey.  You mustve had your hands full.  Which were still keeping under our hats!  That bastard taped over me!   We're gonna see each other naked.  You may wanna get some more of those too.   I'm going to get bigger!  Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss. _B_  Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.  You are ready to make a commitment!   This is from the woman at the bar.  Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.  Hmm.  Because you do.  Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14?  Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.  Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, Im gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, Ill set you up with a clean one.  Okay, Im sorry. I didnt mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? Cause lets face it, were at Monicas.  I broke it. All right. Well, thats just the way that goes.  Okay, good.  Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you cant answer.  Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words!  Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh!  Oh, youre a lot mischievous! Well, itll dry.   Okay, you sit with your brother and sister nowwho arent there!  _B_  No, dont look directly at them!  So uh, what are you guys doing?  Yknow, I dont think were going to settle this.  Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that Im not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.   Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?   Phyllis is sitting in a chair.  Hey.  I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.  Were you the ones called the cops?!  Do you see this?   Oh, my God!   Hey dude, you ok? Sorry bout before.  Yeah...  Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.  Okay.  Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.  Well, I think so.  My God, you're choking!  That better?  Whats a nubbin?  Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.  What the heck is that?  _B_  No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.  All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.   How about we settle this right now!  There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!  Okay. I suck!  So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?  Joey!  Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!  Don't worry, it's out there!  I think I just need lunch.  Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isnt about the room, this is about what the room represents! And unfortunately, this room  could destroy you!!  Ohh, I love birds.   I thought we talked about this. I dont like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isnt juice. All juice, okay?  " by doin it."  How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and Ill make you a nice martini.  You go back out there, and you seduce her till she cracks!  Uh, in her defense, shes right. I am stronger. I would destroy you.  Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.  Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut. _B_  So lets talk a little bit about your duties.  What the hell are you talking about,  "The south will rise again man."  Do you wanna do it at the same time?  Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?  You were great. But they still made fun of you.  Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!  Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I mean, I have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped.  Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!? _B_  Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?  Okay! All right! How was she? _B_   One second.  _B_  Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming cause, cause her eyes keep going like this.   Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.  Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!   So? Huh? What do you think?  Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this. _B_   Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.  I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.   How do you feel?   What?!  Yeah!  Damnit Carl! _B_  Listen umm, Ive been thinking, its not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.   Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?   Why not?  I cant believe were here.  Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, youll know its mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, theres a very noticeable rip.  What? Did her ass explode?!  Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too.  And you are...  I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.  _B_ Woah, woah, woah australopithicus isn't supposed to be in that display. No. No. No, n, homo-habilus was erect, australopithicus was never fully erect.  Hmph.  So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?  You have three nipples?  Then why are you smoking?  I dont think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in.  Draw!!    Everyday use.  No, sorry.  Umm, Gene.  No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!  I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world!  I tried! They won't take her back.  You wanna eat?  My treat!  No it is not!  What?   Phyllis sees what Im doing.  Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing yknow youre in the bathtub together and shes feeding you strawberries?  How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?  Of course. _B_  Keep dancing. _B_  Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything youre really bad at yknow, sexually?  No Im not. Why would you say that? Thats just mean.  Now, over to Chandler.  Now youll be heading a whole division, so youll have a lot of duties.  Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!  One!  Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.  You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring Boss," "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss," "Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"  Okay good.   You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me?   Well... I just talked to Sid, we are definitely putting in an offer on the house... a-a-and I'll bet we get it.  Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.  Shhhh!  ...what the hell does she want with half a boat... _B_  Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks youre going to call her?  Yup, and waaay out of your league.   Oh?   Oh my God! What happened?  Not your type?! She's gorgeous!  Hey! Samboucha Margarita?   Okay, Ive got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?  Oh, no. Oh, no.  Joey has got a secret peephole!   Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself.  Did you hear what I said Bing?  No! That's-that's my arm!  Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed em, bathed em, and put em to bed.  Oh, this ones for Chandler. Here.  Hey Mon.  Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.  Yknow, just some good faith money to hold the date.  Eh, you work for that.  See, this is exactly what we do not have time for.   Okay.   Yes, is that okay?  Come on thats not fair! I mean you havent even heard me play!  Chandler sucks! He couldnt have gotten this good!  Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!  Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!  You are married though.  Thank you. My hair is very amused.  That's fine.  Try the bottom one.  Closing Credits _B_  With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!  Which one?  Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency. _B_  Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.  Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks shes like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!  One.  I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.  Guest.  No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!  Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?  You still want to move in together right?  Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers theyre just, you know, theyre nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.   Iced tea.  For further reading on the above story, please check out The One Where Joey Moves Out.}  Knit, good woman, knit, knit!  _B_  That really was some of your best work.  Umm, not without you, lover.  So, this is my bra.  Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?  Ohh!  And I love spending time with you.  _B_  Are you sure?  But therell be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them.  Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss.  Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.  You broke the pact!   How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that?  _B_  No... he killed his father with a shovel.  But other than that, he's a great guy.  All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see you later, neighbor.   You did? How?  She's still asleep.  Fine.  Look, it's just a little more complicated...  Alright.  This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?  You cant just say, Nice to meet you, good night?  Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! Youre okay.  Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!  Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.  Hes right, what she did was unforgivable.  Bye, Gene.  Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me.    Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming.  Hey, what's up?   Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.  The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?  Monica!   I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.  Okay! See you later!   Oh, I see.  _B_  You do?!  Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.  No.  Well go! Go move it!   Chandler?  In a minute!  But Ben is coming over tonight and he cant see this.  No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him? _B_  Three!   Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?  It's kind of a package deal!  I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.  Do you think they recognize each other from in there?  Do you think they recognize each other from in there?  Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?  No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.  Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here. _B_  Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?   Well, call me if you change your mind.   Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.  All right Ill talk in code.  Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?  God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, Oh, Im so talented. and Oh, Im so pretty, and Ooh, I smell so good.  I ah Oh! Ill squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!  No! _B_  All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!  Okay!  Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me,  here.  Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!  Ross didnt scare you?  No Im not. Why would you say that? Thats just mean.  Ooh, lets open them!  Its hard for some people!  I have to be up in seven minutes.  You should be. I'm very bendy.  I'm gonna kiss you now.  No-no! No! No! You dont tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks Im a soap actor.  Who are you?  Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.  From the tequila factory?  Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, youve been Bamboozled!  We can go into detail  Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.  What?  That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.   Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.  Are you awake?  Oh, me too...   Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?  Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...  Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.  Chandler! Chandler!   Ha!  Ahhhhhhh!  And hey! Just so you know, its not that common! It doesnt happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!  Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.  Whats up?  How might you be wrong?  Umm, I'd love too!  Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.  Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a pictureI didn't have my camera!  Excuse me?  Why do I have to decide?  I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!  Ohh.  Oh, youre so sweet.  Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?  Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.  Yeah.  All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.  No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.  Eh, we weren't that close anyway!   Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.  I thought I was something that we both wanted!  We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.  Who's that dirty old lady?  You want his yearbook?  Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?  Ow!  Awful! Horrible!  Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?   Yeah!!  Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!  Come on, two on one.  Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that. _B_  Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!!  Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.  Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?  Come here, I want to show you something!  Is it the same thing that Chandler had?  Hee hee!   Okay look, Chandler, if this  you have got to listen!   Youre gonna throw that juice at me, arent ya?  Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didnt want to talk to anyone, especially me?  Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!   Shes still here.  No! Why does he have to go?  Really?!  Yeah baby!  Ooh.  Come here. I can breath through my mouth.  Yeah!!  All right then, well have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, youll fit in well here.  Eh!  _B_ _B_  No, but you can't.   They thought Joey was a child?  I didn't.   Well, you have fun tonight.  Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy.  Huh?  Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!  Chandler!  It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...  Ill get the hat. _B_  Joey! I cant believe you just did that!   Gin.   I'll be right back.  What was that?  You do?  Dude, tell me she actually told you this.  Boy, I love carrots! Oh!  Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you.  Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife  and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm,  my body.    Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.  How good is that?  Okay! , the coffee table forward , and taped a square outline on the floor.)  Eh, better her than me! Hey, lets bake cookies! _B_  But my apartment!  I love the way you look every night Chandler!  Thats why I made you this tape! Happy Birthday! Love Janice!  Oh my God, you guys!!   You thought about that?   Hey! There you are!  No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.  Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.   Well you can have the suite if you want. We dont care about where we stay. Were here to celebrate our love together. We dont have to get free stuff. We just want to be together.  Hey! Its your bachelor party.  I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of it.  Oh!  Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!?  Well, thanks.  Hey.  Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.   Hey!   That's-ah what I suspected-ah. _B_  This is the worst Christmas ever.  What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.  Oh.  Ohh. Ohh, youre out of your mind.  Doh!!  Ive got it!  Hi Emily!  No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just I just Kinda  Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!   I'm Monica.  All right, ready?  Hi Chandler.  Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?  Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!  Why?  No reason, Im just saying that uh Thats where Ill be.  _B_  Oh.  Here it comes. Our first kiss.   I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?  Absolutely.  You can relax Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.  No.  Oh, I will.  Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?  Oh... my...  It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.  It's really not that big!   Geez! Are you ready?  Okay.  No, its not just cause Im jealous.  I mean Im not, Im not, Im not jealous, okay? Its Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.  Will you stop!  Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.  Well, youre timing couldnt be better. Shes not my girlfriend anymore.  Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no!  Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...  Thats all youre basing this on?  Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?  Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!  See?  This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and its still walking distance to the kitchen.   Thank you.  But the mess!  Yeah, but Im your brother. Were family. Thats the most important thing in the world.  Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.  Who?  How many kids were we gonna have?  Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!  Are you okay?  Because you sent away the dog!  Youre kidding? She seems so...  Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.  I dont want to. You do it!  Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don’t want to hurt her.  Yeah.  _B_  Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...  With Carol?  Oh.  Well, you know.  Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . .  Oh my god.  How many of those have you had?  Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!!!   My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.  Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, dont I have to wait a while?  Ewwwww!  I have so got it. Theres gonna be rumours about this, theres no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.  All right, so well get a little coffee, and get energized, and well head back out.  Thank you!  Okay.  Turn.  Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?  Is this movie gonna be my big break?  Dude, what'd you have?  Whatever Linus, Im opening mine.  All right.   Hey.  Why dont you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldnt have to apologize.  Yeah baby! _B_  Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?  And why not?!  What? Are you serious?!  Joey smells gas!  Poo?  I think you're better than you think you are.  Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.  NO!  Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you?  How?  Chandler, what are you talking about?  Whoa! You had sex today?  No? What happened, big guy?  Aw, God Ross. Oh. _B_  Wow!  That word was swans. _B_  Hey, this isnt like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!    Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?  I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.  Yeah, she broke up with me.  Oh, Ill get it.   Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! Theres a lot of theories that didnt pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.  I thought you could use the help.  Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!  All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.   Okay!  Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.   Youre right, youre right I shouldnt freak out. Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!  What?  A-ohh!  Ohh. Oh thats right thats right. Thats Richards favorite place too.  What else did you think about?  What?!  Thats unbelievable.    I cannot believe that I did this. Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it!  "Okay Rachel! Here are the invitations Rachel! Now be very careful Rachel! Please, drinking no liquids around the invitations Rachel!"  Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh oh-oh-oh   You do it!  Everyone at our school heard it!  Bye!  Bye!  You comin'?   Uh-huh.  I know. Yeah.  Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.  Were kidding!  Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous  or very  stingy.  Oh! And dont let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.   Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!   Oh, great!  Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!  Turn! Turn!   Come on, we can't let them win!   What?!   The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.   Mmm.  Will you get us better gifts?  Okay, Chandler, you go first.  Yes, Ill meet em.  Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.  _B_ _B_ _B_ _B_ _B_ _B_  Its not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! Its a beautiful ring!  All right, I I have to ask.   Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food!  What's the matter?  Oh man!   Cute PJs! Youre really livin it up here in London huh?  Youre wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?  You're-you're what?!   So whats your name?  Poo?!   Know when to stop.   Hey. Where's Joey?  Mmmm hmm! For your boob job! Monica, Rachel,  Don’t blame the questions!  I'm not supposed to tell you!   Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting.  I don't know what to say... I mean, you know, obviously we have this... heat between us.  Wow!  I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler.   You know what, everything's gonna be okay.   Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be. _B_  I know, it is isnt it?  Oh! Youre right. Oh God. But, before I can say good-bye, theres something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, its like, I finally understand what Lionel Richies been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, its like movie love, youre my soulmate, and I cant believe were not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.  So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?  Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.  Well then, do it better!  Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, thats why I let people watch.  That doesnt sound like thinking to me!  No, 19.  Im sick of the signs! Its too fast, Im happy the way things are!  Uh-hmm.  My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.   Yknow what? I-I dont want a big, fancy wedding.  Chandler, what were you thinking?  I see. I guess you never really know whats goin on inside a persons head.  Yes. Yes. Just here  and there . _B_   Not on the ones we sent out.  Let me see! Show them!  I miss this.  No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.  Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher wanted?"  Well no, but um.  Mailbox.  No, we're alright.  All right.   Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?  I can make you a legend. I can make you this generations Milton Berle.  Well, if you think it will help.  Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...  She's there?!  No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!  Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!  Dude you said, "No!"  Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?  Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?  Hey!  Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.  Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?  So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.   Is Joey here?  Doesnt it ever just freak you out that-that youre never gonna be with anybody new again?  Chandler? What an unusual name! You mustve had terribly fascinating parents.  Well, we had a little fight.  Yeah.  Don't do the dance.  Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.  Chandler!!! Chandler!!!  Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!  I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.  But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don't think we should get this house now.  Okay.  Okay.  Still doing the screening thing?  I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, "It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does." _B_  I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.  Why dont we just go on two.  Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.  What?  You saved them! You guys! Oh God, youre the best!  Right.  Should we do something?  Well, Ive been better. But, Im all right. So you like her huh?  Yknow I dont think you should be talking at all in there! I think youve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!  Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what Ive got?    Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something. _B_  Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!  Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot!  Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!  Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.  I dont want things to change! Do you?  Oh my God! I love that!  No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.  Chandler?  Oh, youre such a gentleman.  Come on! Were going to my place!  _B_  No, I-I miss hanging out with you.  I know!  Its all gonna be okay. Theyre just so happy that Im not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.  Oh my God, Rachel!    You are really frightening me.    Nothing. It's fine.  Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again.   Oh my God!  Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .  Plastic spoons. Great.  Wait here. Breathe.   Im kinda beat.  You should! How is she?  Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.  What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now! _B_  Oh now, don't give away the farm!   I feel really sad that we're not really there anymore.  You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?  What message?  Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?  Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.  Wouldnt you be?  Phoebe, hes gotta be in the room for that to work.  Just, I love you so much. Just Its just sometimes it bothers me that Im never gonna have that feeling. Yknow when you meet someone for the first time and its new and exciting? Yknow that rush?   Yeah, I know...  ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.  _B_  You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isn't it? How d'you get a biggertable? You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shutup Monica. Whoo, I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.  I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.   There y'go.  Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair.  You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?  I don't know what... you're talking about.  Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.  Oh, look at these little bunnies!  Oh, look at these little bunnies!  This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.  But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.  Yeah.  Because its faster.  Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.  No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-Ive got to give my marriage another chance.   Hello?  Yeah, this is she.  Oh! Youre kidding! Youre kidding!  Oh thank you! I love you!  Yeah, well, dont Aww Pheebs, that sucks! me yet.   What are you ever gonna use that for?!  No-no-no, no its uh, its okay.  Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.  Hi.  Yeah!  Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.  Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right  All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because its been three days and its driving me insane!   Chandler, I think Im sick.  There he is!   Uh-hmm.   Mm-mmm.   Well actually, Ross doesn't.  Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Yknow now its like things are different.  Chandler, can you give us a minute?  I have a ring.  I have a ring.  Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.  Who's there?  She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.  Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.  All right.  These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.  It's like a gift.  My mom will.  Hello.  Okay.  Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell. Thats all I have so far. Closing Credits _B_  Oh my God! The millionaires here!  To pay for the gym.   Stop it, stop it, stop it!  Sorry! I'm justI'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!  Chandler.  Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?  I don't believe this!  Jeez, relax! Its not like were mar-ah-ah!!   Continue.  What?! Its 6 oclock!  In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! Thats not the point.  Really?  Okay, but all right youre a guy, does it not freak you that youre never gonna sleep with anybody else?  Uh-huh.  Dont touch her!!  You're so efficient. I love you!  Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.    Hey, what's-what's going on?!  Although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness...  Goodbye Chandler Bing.   Okay.  Okay.  Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy.  Hey, he's not crying.  Well, we had a table in college.  I'm getting ready for the water skiing. _B_ How are you doing?  No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.   Im sorry.    Call her! Call her now!  Yeah. You know why? Cause you came to me first.  Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?  Yeah, it did.  Yeah!   You brought a carrot.  Chandler, why are you doing this?  All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.   All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.  Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest?    I love that idea! _B_  Okay.   Wow! Youre good! After this, we should solve crimes.  I love you.  Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.  Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are dessert stealers! We are living outside the law!  Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now Im not saying that theres any connection here yknow, but they did tell me thats why they got divorced.  Oh sureAnd hey, dont get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I just I miss hanging out just-just us, yknow?  Yeah.  Oh, hi.  Okay. Just for a little while.  Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.  Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.  Yes, and grumpy.  Where have you been?  Guys, please, Im just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?   I slept with Monica.  I was going too.  Umm, I brought some wine. Would you like some?  Really?  What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!  Then all your stuff would be here.  Hey!  Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, Im a doctor, and I had a monkey. Im Doctor Monkey!  I cant believe this Chandler!  Well Thats not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.  Well, not anymore.  Do you have a point?  Im not very fond of New York. Queens I like.  Ooh, what is this sparkle something!  Honey! Huh?  Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like...   No-no-no, wait! We need something old!  Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would it?  All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh!   Alright, let's see..   Alright, let's see..   Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.  No, I-I-I gotta go.   Why hasnt he called Rachel? Why? Why? I dont understand. Why? He said hell call. Why? Why? Chandler Im telling you she has flipped out, shes gone crazy!  But hey, listen just so you know, you might have youre work cut out for you. Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that shes into some other guy. So  There y'go, kids.   We're rehearsing a Greek play.  What?  I don't know. Maybe pizza?  Chandler.  Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!  Come on! I really need your help!  Oh my God! Thats great! Oh wow!  Youre a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!  Shes leaving for three months.  What?! What?!  Hey Chandler!   Lift!! And slide!  Yeah but the Swing Kings? Yknow they suck so much that people actually die at their concertsThey just stop living.  Even with me?  You know, you think I would.   Y'guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to thebeauty salon?   I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!  Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago.   I'm movin' out like we talked about.  He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.  Here we go. Im serving my last cup of coffee.  There you go.  Enjoy.   Is everything okay?  I know!!  Hey!  Okay, fine.    So, here we are. Nervous?  I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!  That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.  Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.  Then youd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesnt make any sense.  Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!  Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldnt. Thats why Im here. Maybe we could attack them together?  That-thats a no. _B_  Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?  Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!  How?  I know, I just thought it would be fun.  Heeeyy! Hey!  That'll work! Alright, alright, I can get my own coat. _B_  Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.  Heavy thing, not getting lighter!  Honey, honey, people are looking.  Come on, this isnt funny. She thinks its my fault that you havent called her. You have to call her!  Who?  Yeah, me too.  You seen Sandy?  No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?  Why, exactly?  Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?  Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!  ...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street? _B_  Fine, Ill rub it on myself.  Wait a minute!  My last Kit-Kat bar!   Wait a minute!  How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?  Well, what is the other reason?  Really?  It's just a fur ball.  Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.  Eh.   Ohhh. Big boy, riding the busHey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?  Yeah?  Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.  Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you.  _B_ Score! Now can we go?  Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.  All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesnt mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise youre just an idiot in a box!  Hello!  Oh yeah!  It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references.  Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.  Hey!  No, I want this to happen.  Yeah.   Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.  Live together? There have been no signs for that.  The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didnt even get half a cup! Nothin!!  Its your joke.  Okay.    Uh-huh.  Oh, well Im uh  What if I have babies, okay? I mean Im gonna look different. Im okay with that, but Im not sure that you are!  Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.   I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness.  So youre bald?  Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.   Okay, now we just need something borrowed!  Hey.  Yeah, um, Im, Im leaving now.    The game is over, we eat now?  Well then youre going to have to take her out again.  What?  It's nice that he has someone. _B_  Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer thanOhhh!    Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night.  Well, who doesn't love dogs?  Ah, he's a tap dancer!  Yes, some would say that is a lost art.  He's a pimp!  There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp!  Hello?   It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.  So do I.    Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.  Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!  Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.   Hey, is Chandler here?  Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you dont! _B_  Well what if I told you you can do it in my apartment?  Well you have to because maybe its stupid.  Come here! Come here!  Sweetie you dont have to worry. No, besides yknow what? Im gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid  Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'.  You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...?   Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.  Hey guys. Monica and  Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.   Will you hold Ben for a sec?  Come here. Come here.  Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.  All right!!    You grow up. _B_  Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!  Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!  So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?  It was.  Commerical Break _B_  Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.   Did not.  Not if you're gonna be like this!  YES!!!!!!!!  And he never played before either! Yknow what I think? I think beginners luck, very important in Cups.  Hi, Chandler. There you are.  Yeah?   Yeah you will!  And, are you kiddin me?!  Oh wow! Okay man, Im sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.  Keep going.  We?   That's stealing!  Well let's see. Maybe he knows where Ross is.  Hey, how's it going  .  Chandler, wait, wait, wait...  Seven hundred bucks!  You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.  Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels. _B_  I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.  I dont care! I dont care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows its actually ended. And, I dont care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!  Hey Duck, is Chick here?  And what?! Did you sleep with her?!  By all means.   You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.  Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you.   Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!   Oh, mine! Mine! Mine!

You take half and I take half!  I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.    Yknow whats weird?   Look honey, you dont have to do this, okay? Its the strength you have inside that means the most to me. Youre loyal, youre honest, and you have integrity! Thats the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!  Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!  Hey hey, can I help?  Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?  Uh-oh.  Wow, its big!  Right. Okay, lets play. Lets go.  No! I did!  Yeah, I know.

Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas. _B_  No thanks man, I'm not uh, I'm not really into sports.  Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.  Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.  Thats fine!  Ooh, I dont know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.  Hey!  What?!! Thats even worse!!  Oh yeah, thats very nice. Plus, yknow they were free and theyre too small.   Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!   Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!  Uh, Rachel, Ive been thinking. I dont think us getting together tonight is such a good idea.

I think Im falling in love with you all over again. _B_  That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, dont bite your nails. _B_  Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!  No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.  Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.  Yeah. _B_  Oh my God! Thats great! Congratulations! Whats the story?!  I know what time you said.  Youre dying?!   Oh for God sake just pick a piece!  Ohhhhh.

You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!  Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!  What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?

Hey, who wants pizza?!  Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!  Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if Im not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity   Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.  Thats also the smaller piece.  Okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and dont come crying to me if you eat your piece too fast.  Oh!!!!  Noo!  Angels.  Wow! You are really fast!

Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.  Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to. _B_  Arrrghh!!   Hello, Chandler.   You really didn't have to.  Wow.  Nah, youre not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.  You're a dork. _B_  Honey wait, Joey, Im sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it   She's bluffing!  Wait! Oh my God! I cant get out!  Ahhh! You are on my list.

Well, yknow what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and theres a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that Im not gonna eat! You know why?!   Hey!   Hey.  So, we did okay at the strip club, right?   I had nothing to do with it.   Okay, it was my idea, but I dont feel good about it.   Gas? Wow! Intense.  Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly its my book to the rescue, huh?  Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.  I dont know.  Let me see the ring.

I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks...  Someday.  Petrie.  That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.  Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.  Uh-huh, yeah.  Hey, thats never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy! Closing Credits _B_   Just do it.   You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and were then gonna go skiing?   Hey!

So now everybody's getting kissed but me.  Chandler, I said I was sorry.  No, its not a sign! Its a very old key!  Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.  Is it okay for me to come in now?    I didnt even tell him to say that. . All right youre off my list.  What?! You kissed!  Hey, here you go.   Chandler?   Hi!  Well, it looks like it wasnt healed after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!   Okay, Im sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.  Hey.  You thought about that?  Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.  Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.  And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive.   You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!  TIME LAPSE    Oh, that's attractive.  So I got it in the junior miss department, big diff. Anyway check it out man, it's gonna make a hell of a conversation piece at out next cocktail party, huh pal?  Will you excuse me I have to um.....  _B_  And a crappy New Year.  Oh wow. I really wish youd call me.  No, were not! Were not leaving!   Oh! Ohh! Oh!!  I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.   All right.   Do you wanna do it at the same time?  Let me see that!  Oh man!  Toby dont.  No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.  No he doesnt!  You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In factyes,  Im, Im sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, Im-Im, Im gonna, Im gonna name the baby Chandler.  Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?  Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldnt have a bag, I justit's just there are other bags that are a little less umm,  controversial.  Oh my God its old!  I cant do it!   Thanks!  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!  And you are about to marry a wonderful man!  Hey! Im marrying a dead woman! _B_  Do you have a sec?  Mrs. Altman? She also made out with Takaka Ci-Kek the night before he went back to Thailand.  Well I dont have them either. Where are they?  Yeah, Im going to take a bath. Im just going to get a magazine.   Chandler?  Uch, you see, I'm ovulating.  How many kids were we gonna have?  She really left.  I didn't know you knew about that.  Chandler.  Yeah, you know, put chips in it, we'll make like a chip chick.  Nighty-nite.  Ill be a fool for you. Im sure, you know I dont mind.  Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird, I would have to say, Chandler.  Finally, I thought wed never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party.   Well, this has been fun.  Yeah.  I dont know.  Yeah, just leave me alone for a while.  _B_  Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.  _B_  Bye!    Yknow, suddenly I find you very attractive.   Thanks! So are you.  It's a Thanksgiving miracle!   There it is.  _B_  One!  Hey.  Toby! Im not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler!   O-Okay!  Excellent, that was excellent.

I dont know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday.  You got me the audition?! Lets hug it up!   I dont know.

I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement Im going to announce that Im pregnant!  Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.  Maybe. But that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors.  Yeah lady! Give us candy!!  Yeah?  Three!    Oh.  Okay, Im never gonna wear them again. I just didnt get a chance to say goodbye.  I know that youre new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum.    How did you get in there?!  Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.  Ew! Ew! Gross gross! _B_   Y'know what?

Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?   A lot of other gas smells  Hey!  It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?  Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, whats the harm in that?  Yeah, where the hell is he? _B_  Uh-huh! Nice try, but you dont get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap!  No I take that back!  Oh thats so sweet.  Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?  That's because I'm in front of them.  You know the book says that whenever she’s sleeping I should be sleeping so…   So? Did have sex, right?  I'm sorry..  I don't want to look at your file! This is over.   So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even.  Hi. Closing Credits _B_  Excuse me?  No, I... I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book.  Oh, my Bing-a-ling. Ill wait for you. Do you even know how long youre going to be gone?  Youre a pathetic loser, right?  How?! When?!  Look!

Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Dont you?  And do you know what girls are really good at?  Yay!  Why?!  Bye.   Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.  Chandler, please dont think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel  How do you figure?  Eh!   Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, youll be fine.   Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep  Mon...I'm so sorry.

Closing Credits _B_  As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute. _B_  IN LONDON!!!  I bet this will work!   I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?  Were just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.  I cant believe Im going to lose this job!  And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!  Well just well just let her stay.  Oh my god!  Youre amazing!  Waiting for candy.  Yeah, Im sorry.  _B_  Hi, Bubbles. Manly.

She really left.  Of course!  Well I did. I really did. And you guys, Ive got to say, Im sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.  It was a mistake. Please dont take this to mean anything, because it doesnt.  And-and-and-and-and-and, and were gonna be friends again!  No-no-no! This chairs not going anywhere.  Hey!  No.  Sorry.  Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?   What did you do to my mom?  Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.  Excuse me.  Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.  Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, hes just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...  Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, "This is 'cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese." Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it must have been for you to find.  Chandler?  Hey.  That was one good minute!  But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!   What?  Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?  I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!   Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.  No!  Kinda like your barcalounger.  Chandler, Im gonna have you arrested.  Really? You promise you wont tell anyone?  And a crappy New Year.  That's right, sex is off the table.  I am never having sex with you again.  Dr. Green, are you feeling better?  _B_  What's you point man?  I think we proved our point.  Whats goin on?  We could eat the wax! Its organic.  Yeah. And yknow, if you wanna cry, thats okay too.  Ooh, uh   That's weird.  I bet they're doing it. Ending Credits _B_   Check it out! Cup hat!  Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup!    Was I talking to her about gas?  What's in the bag?  Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!  Thank you.  Really?  Oh its water under the bridge, forget it!  What?  We want candy! We want candy now!   The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!  Oh, dude Im so sorry!  There you go!    What!?  Dude, well done! You know what? If I die, and Rachel dies, and Monica dies, you can totally take care of Emma.  Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.   Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong.   Hi! Oh my gosh!   Hi! Oh my gosh!   Uh, is your name Chandler?  Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.  I-I cant handle this, you guys.  You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him.  Chandler!  Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!  You said you loved me! I can't believe this!  Wha- Joey and  So we can go out again?  Oh my God! Are-are you crying?  Yeah she said something about crumbies.  I dont know. I know I dont work late tomorrow night.  Yeah? Well, I dont want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.   Look, I am so so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that Im not. Im not even close. And I dont know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that thats dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!   I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why  youre burning in hell!! _B_  I dont know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?!  What are you laughing at Pampers?   Helen drinks.  Will you marry me?  _B_   I dont like this anymore.   Well its just umm Im afraid you might mess it up. _B_   Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?  But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?   That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all.    We had a good time. By the way, I wanted to ask you something. It would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, Jiminy Billy Bob   Is anyone else starting to really like him? _B_ _B_  Cannot feel my tounge. _B_  No, not the used wax.  Come on! Chandler!  Okay, bye!   My identical hand twin!  Can I ask you a question?  I know! I know.  Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.   Candy Lady?  Thats right!  Hey no-no-no-no! Its cool! Its cool! I-Ill only be a second, Im still with my bridesmaid, I justWhere are those condoms you brought?  Great! Were hangin in the kitchen!  Lets stay in the kitchen!  So, so, now do I get Joey?   Ross.  Chandler Bing?  What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?   Ooh, hey! Hey, there little fella.  Mr. Fuzzy-Man, how are you doing?  Aww.  Eww! Oh! Eww! Gross! Idiot!! Stupid little, fuzzy, yellow creature!! Oh look at me, Im so cute, Im a little chick whos disgusting!

I wanna see you take-off.  Noo! Nothing!  Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?  Yes, you did!  Hey man.   And did you notice the ice?  Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch!  Ahhh! Mystical!   Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, Ill dump you too!   I understand completely, theres nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.  Yeah?  Oh, howd she take it?  That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?    So, you gettin tired?  Hey.  Second date!  No!  You we're right, that was fun! I'm gonna go finish packing.  Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo.   Why doesn't my key work and what's all my stuff doin' downstairs?  Hey!  What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!  What the hell is that dog doing here?!   Ending Credits _B_  Yeah, I gotta go.  Chandler! Youve been Rosss best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems.  And now youve taken on Monica as well. Well, I dont know what to say. Youre a wonderful human being. _B_   Why should I help you?!  Why not?   Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!  Ah.   Now you are going to love these.  See ya. Well, this is just us. Monica &  We're all sorry...   I'm Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses, I used to carry around a box of animal crackers like a purse.  Is that the fire alarm?  I think youre right.   Alright, well, be good, I love you.   Yeah!  _B_  You love me!  About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.  Hey! Joey and  Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!   Hey, did she buy it?  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!!  You guys are gonna be so happy!   Well, Im going to take off.  Congratulations man.  They never did, so if you ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?   Fifteen.  Yeah? Me too.  Gettin a little tired though.  Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldnt stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though.

Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?   You know, Chappy's too small to handle all this snow. Someone's gonna have to walk him down the aisle.  Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.  Oh, okay. Will you take my place?  Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants.

I promised you a stripper , and youre gonna get a stripper.   We can't afford that.

They seem all right with it! Opening Credits _B_  The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.  Sorry.   See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!  Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.  Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.  Okay, so Richard, Richard!  That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.   Oh my God. What is th its like a guy never lived in here. Look, youve got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous.  Its spreading already.  Why havent you told them?!  I dunno what it is, it just doesnt quite feel like Christmas to me.  I made that joke up.   Is that a swing?  A hot girls at stake and all of the sudden hes Rain Man.  Ill give up my ticket.  Thanks.  Pheebs?  Do you think you could get through a poem?  Do you happen to know what Im going to say?  Oh uh-uh, no-no-no-no-uh-uh.  _B_  I got a maid. Yay!  She had a point.    Awesome.  Do you have any ideas?  I will explain it to her.  Oh, you'll see my friend. _B_  Ok, here we go!   Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.   So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?   It's like a giant hug.  Or facing a bitch of a commute.  We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?  I'm tellin' you, she leaned back; I could see her brain.  Can I uh see something?   Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.  And twenty-five it is.  Now we can finally watch Green Acres the way it was meant to be seen.  So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!  Hey.   Ross, ten o'clock.  Okay.   Where did you, when did you, how did you...  How did you get a girl like that?  Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?  Well the vet seems to think thats shes becoming a rooster.  Were getting a second opinion. Opening Credits _B_  Do we pay for this?  I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.  It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!  Hi there!  Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?  Thats our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why dont I justwhy dont I just cover you for a while?  Thats great!  Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third...  Hey!!  Hey.  I got glasses!  No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy whos going like this   Can we start over?  Because it's too delicious.  Do you want me to call?  We got the honeymoon.  A Speedo? Uh, I dont have a Speedo. Im gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit.   Honey, its not the bath I enjoy, its the wet, naked lady.  I dont see him.  Do you see him?  I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...  _B_ Can you hear him now?  So, who does?   No! We're not borrowing money.  Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.  A dinosaur died a million years ago?  Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.   Bob here. Opening Credits _B_  Oh, she's goin' somewhere.  Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.  Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.  That was there when I got here. _B_  See that is the problem with invisible dentists.  Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?   Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.   Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?   Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!  Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?! Kathy's Co- Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!  How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?  Or we can do the actual telephone thing. Opening Credits _B_  Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.  Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!    Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?  Why havent you told them?! Wouldnt they be happy?!  See now it feels like Christmas! Opening Credits _B_  Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke hed ever heard.  Yuck!  Yeah.  Skull?    Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! Whats wrong with me? Ooh, dont open that door. Opening Credits _B_  Uh honey, I know you dont like to relinquish control  Oh, okay.  Hi!  Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.   And so young.  It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do.  It means...   Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.  So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!   What've you been up to?  So uh, which one is mine?  Not a one.  No, ten o'clock.  Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?   Yeah? Opening Credits _B_  Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.  No-no, why dont you hang on to that one.    Hey.  Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.  Maybe we shouldnt pay our phone billfree phone sex.  Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.  Good-bye muscles!! Opening Credits _B_  Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.  Its not charity, Joe  Oh, is that against the rules?  Oh thats right. Its your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?  And I think Ross is generous too.  Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you. Mrs.  Oh all right.  No I didnt!  I dont know what it is, I just cant take a good picture.  Oh, okay, time's up!  No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate,  Mommas Little Bakery.  I feel terrible, Im a horrible, horrible, horrible person.   Monica, there are no words  There are no words! This should not be this hard!  The wedding pictures?  Theyre terrific, and they live right here in the city.  Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.  Let her know I like her? What are you, insane?  It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem?  I'm right, right? Joey and  _B_ No! Wait!  Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.  You have to pick your moments.   No, no! We made this decision together.  ... And where's this money coming from?    You or me?  All right, Okay, all right. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.  Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem. OPENING TITLES _B_ _B_  Hey, you feelin' better?  Hey. MONICA and  God that is good TV. OPENING TITLES _B_  I didn't realize that.  Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.  Okay, thats like the least fun game ever.  No!!  Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.  Goin out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didnt work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.  You dont have to stop having fun just because Im here. Kathy didnt cheat on all of you.  Well, except you.   That's sweet, Joey.  Yeah!  I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I justI didn't know what it was!  Oh, okay.  Here you go.   What?   Hey!   Is that your tiny little box, thats too small to put anything in?  Why wouldnt they be happy?  That was like 5 years ago.  Im not gonna mess it up.   Already?!  Staying out of the way.  Youre an actor!  Look, shes really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.  I kinda like it here.  Muskogee? That's like four hours from Tulsa! WOO HOO! Narrator from  Well, how you died was funny.  This is..shhh! Second   It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.  Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused.  It's a whole big boob story.  Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is "spermtastic"!  He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.  What did I marry into?  My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle.   Can you hold on a moment? I have another call.  I love her.  Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?  _B_ Ohh yes.  Oh, right, right, shut up.  Phoebs, play with meeee.  Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns. OPENING TITLES _B_   There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!  You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!  All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.   Dont look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!  That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienists blouse.   It must take you forever to find your keys.  She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!  Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!  Oh, so thats why the priest threw holy water on me.  Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.  I could die.  They couldnt be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.  Were you so late because you were burring this woman?  Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.   Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!   Hello, Chandler Bing.  Hey!  Okay uh, heres the electric bill.   I think it's winning.  I see.  Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really.  Nothing. _B_  That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.  Yeah, Im not in that.  Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?  Too?  Whats up?  Not the disposable cameras from the tables.  Im sorry, were just kinda excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with.  You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?  Yeah well, too bad were gonna have to return them.  Honey, its 200 on a Wednesday and Im watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?  And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?  If only there was something in your head to control the things you say.   Right. Just stay there. I'm coming home.  Well, that's what we said about Joey...  That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard. Opening Credits _B_  No way!  Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?  Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet.  Joey, she does not look fat. Opening Credits _B_  Okay, let's do it.  What?  Rhythm?  GET OUT NOW!!  Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.  No, no, no, I dont, I dont really wanna play.  Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.  Oh.  Nope, that patch is no good.   Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!!  Huh.   What?  What are you writing?  Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on! Mr.  Wouldnt that be Frank the III?  Hello!  Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.  Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.   Is that Joey?!  Let me talk to him! _B_  Ross, just for my own piece of mind, youre not married to anymore of us are ya? Opening Credits _B_  No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, youre going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.  What? What? Why?!  Hey Joe whats up?  So you kissed her, so what happened after that?  Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?  Joey   Ah, finally an explanation.  Oh well, we dont because we got the other pl-place.   Shes not gonna say no.  Oh, I got some thoughts on that.  So  Im so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You shouldve seen her. Writing, writing, writing! _B_  Yes, I distinctly remember cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?  Im so sorry.  I'm sorry I won't be here.  Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.  It kills over one americans every year.  I'm sorry.  Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.  No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.   I'm back.  _B_ Do we dare?  No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.  Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.  Morning.  She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!  Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one cant get mad.  Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.  How can she be great if shes from Poughkeepsie?  That joke wouldve killed in Albany.  Are you aware that you're still talking?   Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me!  Its been six months! Its not funny!  Pheebs, I dont understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?  Uh, yeah.   She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.    So uh, whats this thing youre auditioning for?  Hey!   Okay, you get her in here.  You bolt the door. Ill be in the closet. Opening Credits _B_  That sounds like my first bike.  My dad gave me his old one.  Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. Im buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.  Ill tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home.  Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?  Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?  Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?  Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.  Yea yea.   Aren't you one of the stars of popular daytime soap Days of our Lives?  Is that really necessary?  Oh hey Monica.   And we're changing.  _B_ _B_  Yes please.  Well, it's official there are no good movies.  What a wank!  Thats not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Dont say that I dont have goals!  I was shrieking... like a Marine.   Hey.  I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.  Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?  Wait! Youre going out with Kathy!  I dont know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.   Oh yeah?  Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you  never go out of stylewhat did you throw away?   Like finding money with naked people on it! Mr.  Might wanna open with the snowman.   Okay, bye!   So, well do the rest of the bills later then? Opening Credits _B_  Yes talk to her. Be a man.  Is this why they dont like me or why you dont like me?  I can see why thats hard to resist.  So shes just waiting over there for ya?  Opening Credits _B_  Seriously?  Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.   No!  Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in vegetables, Joey?  All right, now look at her and tell me she doesnt look exactly like her sister.  Whats the matter?  I have you.  He pulled a quarter out of my ear!  Good morning everyone, it's nice to see our team togetherfor the first time. Now, before we get started, are there anyquestions?  Yes, Ken is it?   Oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!  Thanks.  I'll see you new year's day.  You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!  Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.  I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!  Tonight?!  Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond?  Oh, there it is!  Tonight?!  Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond?  Oh, there it is!  Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?  Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.  Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.  Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'  Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.  _B_  Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesnt try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.  Whos number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.  Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.  Hey, look at this!  Theyre lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.  Hi guys!  Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!   That. Opening Credits _B_  Yes! Well that-yes.  No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg. Opening Credits _B_  Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.  Are you judging them by their covers? Because youre really not supposed to do that.  Its okay, I want this to be your night too.  To Monica.  Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking.   But youre still my friend?  What? What did you take a picture of?  ...little playthings with yarn?  Well what did it do?  Oh my God, whats up?!  What?! No! No!  No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.  No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office  Am I producing them?  Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?  She's cheating on Joey with Ross!  Maureen Rosilla.   No.  Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.  I want you out.  Because the kids need new shoes.  Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.  Yeah, all right, Ill play.   All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. Id like know whether thats several big fish or just one big fish.  No way!  No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a  Hey!   Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.  Well, Im upsetfor you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.   Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.  Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.   Hello!  I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.   And the bunny got away.   What?  No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldnt take it.  Defend yourself.  Yknow, itll be okay. Itll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then well tell em.  Hey!  What in Gods name is that?!  Really?  Theyre twins!   No, Im not!  Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance  Her what?!!  Hey Pheebs, whats up?  Oh!  Shes growing inside you.  What are you doing?  Man, if only youd gotten here sooner.    Well, don't believe everything you hear, Ken. But yeah, that's true. Alright, let'sget started, by take a look at last quarter's figures.  Ah, Claudia, aren'tyou supposed to blow smoke up the bosses' ass?  Oh, well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face. _B_  What are you going to do?  Did I not mention that?  "So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"  Ok!   Nice!    Nice!   So, uh, how often can you do it?  Ok.  Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.  Ya know, the man's got a point. _B_  Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.  No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.  Well, how do you find clothes that fit?  Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.  Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.  Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.  Hey.  All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I cant believe I missed it.  He thought you said gonad.  Opening Credits _B_ Health  Sorry man.   Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person. _B_  Yeah, I guess.  Sure I would!  Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.  That is lucky.  To Monica!   Oh, whats at 800?  Sure! Thats one of the great things about being engaged. Im not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore. The  During this time are you, are you still my best man?  Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?  Could you want her more?  A vending machine?  Oh no-no, no you dont, just come back.  Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."  Couldn’t sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldn’t sleep. Y’know? I was like, if I fall asleep now I’ll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I’ll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldn’t fall asleep.  Monica, can I talk to you for a sec?   Monica, can I talk to you for a sec?   Hey.  Next time, can I say breathe?  Next time, can I say breathe?  Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.  One. . . two. . . two and a half. Okay, just show me one of them. _B_  Where did you hear it from before?  Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.  I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.   Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night.  Where exactly were around ten-ish?  Oh my God! Whos gonna watch that?!  Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.  Well, I have a call in about that.  Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you.  Well, you-you know what I meant.   Oh no-no-no-no!  Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour.  That didn't happen, I made that up!  No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.  The British are coming?   Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!   Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!  Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?  I was not flirting.  Yeah, yeah! Me too!  How much did I love The King and I?   We actually missed it.  I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, yknow? But I have to trick him into taking it so I wont hurt his pride.  Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didnt I?  You are aware that shes not a monkey, right?  Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldnt you be at work?  Hey!  So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.   Give me it!   You didnt think I used to wear glasses, right?  All right, but I should warn you, Im not going. Im going.  Opening Credits _B_  You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?  Because its flattering!  Come on Monica! Come on Monica!   Couldnt I just say, "This is Ross?"  What?! What are you talking about?  We really didnt get a chance to  You had a bachelorette party?!  Oh!   Its a dog.  Lets.  Opening Credits _B_  No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Rightnow, I can't remember why.  You're not allowed to smokein this office. Not right?  Well, you proved them wrong.   ...AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT!  --- Opening Credits --- _B_  Hey, that was really good!   Zack!  I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?  I used to have that bumper sticker.   You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!

She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work. She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore.   That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.  Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?  We don't need to remedy that.  Thank you, buddy.  Hey, man. What's up?

Are you wearing makeup?  Really?! I didnt think girls ever just wanted a fling.  Without me?!  We dont know what could make this go away.   All this lying has been hard on us too.  And you're gonna make them all disappear.  Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursdays was just our thing man! Opening Credits _B_  You left a shoe here?!  Be right there sweetums.  A totally different situation. Opening Credits _B_   Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.  What, you guys really think that Im that shallow?  And say nothing?  Does South Oregon have a sports-team?  There you go. _B_  Hey! What are you guys doing?  No Rach, its not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasnt that much fun. _B_  Do I still call you Ross?  Oh.   Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.  Do you?  Hey! Did you have the baby yet?  Okay. Wow.  All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas eve and you'd rather be with your familys, but there's *no* call  for writing "Screw you, Mr. Bing!" on the back of my chair!  -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler.   A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.  David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!  David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!   You see what I mean. Opening Credits _B_  Why are you wearing my apron?  Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year. _B_  Man, I am so beat.

Y'know what maybe its gonna be okay, I mean its been a week.  Yeah.   Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.  All right look, I think its time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.  Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, cause I wanna trade for her.  So what job did you get Joe?   Would you give me one minute!! Please. Opening Credits _B_  Isnt this amazing?  Did they teach you that in your anger management class?

Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!   Hey! _B_  Oh, yes, could I have one of those.   Well that would help the pride thing.  Hey!  Oh, good, Ross! Youre parents like me, right? _B_  Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?  Hey!  So.... I quit.  Phoebe!   How about those three-pointers?  Come on! Why are we here?!  Lets not do that any more.   I thought we werent gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Yknow, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.  I think thats the youngest girl ever to reject me.  Its your parents anniversary and youre going to talk about their dead pet?  Alright, lo...look. I don't smoke anymore. But if the restof you want to light up, go ahead, it's fine.  So youall smoke then? That's almost rude, that I'm not.  Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"  Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.   Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.   Ok, pure evil , horny and alone .

It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!   Or what my Father called Thursday night. Opening Credits _B_  My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me. Opening Credits _B_  I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?  Well, not at first.    Wish me luck.  That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.  And no one touches the air around the TV!  Well, yeah actually.  Done.  Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, Ill be sure to give him your shoe.  Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?  Its my joke.  Im so sorry youre sick.  Oh, I dont know man. I havent talked to her in like ten years.  Thats okay Pheebs, were not having a party or anything, so you dont have to get us   Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.  In London?  Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaning Dont let Phoebe in.   I dont know what thats like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, "I love you," was, "Oh crap!"  Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it.  But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?  That would be advice!!  That would be advice!!  Ooh! That's my girl!  Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!  Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"?  No? Divorce?  Where are you going?   Men are here.  Where are you going?  Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?  Joey, no means no! _B_  Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.  Y'think?  I just saw Janice.  There you go!    Hey, does anybody need anything copied? Im going down to the Xerox place.  Thanks.   Youre not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.  Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.  Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?   Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?  Yknow what? Theres some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?  It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.  Thanksgiving 1978 _B_ Mrs.  Ohh.  Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts.  Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.  You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.   Well, I like danger.  Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go!   You okay there man?  No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person! _B_  What?!  Okay.  Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?  Well Monica just told me that they dont.  What if I had had the guts to quit my job? Id probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my jobs fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I dont have to wear a tie.  Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!   Hi Monica.   And those guys were this  close to lettin us play this time too.   The hot chicks?  Im sorry, who?  Thats great!  Whos the father?  Okay, well Im gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed.  32 Joe. Youre 32!  Front Desk  Oh hey!  No, were just four people with neck problems. You talk like this.  _B_ The   Ken, please! No, I can't, I can't smoke. If I smoke,my wife would kill me.  Hey. Where've you been?  "Smoke away."   You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion. _B_  Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?  Look out kids, hes coming!   Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.  You're definitely scaring here.  Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?  Wish it!  Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?  Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this  What's going on?  I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.  Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!   Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.  Ohh, yeah.  You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred  So he has to be a male who has at least $50.  Yeah, Im not sure I can do that. _B_  So are we friends again?  Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.  I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.  Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?  We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?  _B_   I'm leaving you.  _B_  You can't leave me alone with her.  Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back. Monica and  You can't leave me alone with her.  You got waaaay too much free time.  Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.  I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.  Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...  Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kids pretzel at them.  Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.  Hey.  Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, Ill be your boyfriend.   Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.   Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.  Oh thats not true! Thats not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it  Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it  Her initials  No-no, I dont think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!  Well, I have a girlfriend, Im-Im happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.  Oh no-no-no!   Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week! _B_  No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.  Okay!  So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?   Do you know why?  Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...  Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.  If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.  So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?  Die Hard still great!  Wow thats actually pretty cool.  But we dont know the neighbors.  So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!  I always liked you, Ken.  _B_   You hear that? You may not be with your familys, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.  I didn't know it was a big secret.  Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.  Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.  That was so lame.  Ok, that's Eric.  Peter Parker.   Hey.   Ill go.  No, no, no, you say that proudly.  Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right. Opening Credits _B_  Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.  _B_  Wow!!

Me too...   Who?  This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!  This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!  Had it.  Nope, not this time.  Here goes.   Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.  Bye!  Why is that so funny?  Oh, come on! Its not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually Im pretty much just in there by myself.   Do you know which one you're gonna be?  Kathys with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!  Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?   Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?  Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.  Hey!  So, what are you gonna do?  It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.   Well if people dont know they shouldnt just guess! _B_  Ah, youre still just a little fat girl inside arent you?    Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.   Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...  Nah, Monicas watching some cooking show. Come on, I dont want to miss when they were skinny.  Whoa, she's pretty.   It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.   Whatd you rent?  Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.  Female   Okay. _B_  Why not?  You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn? Mr.   We didnt play it!! Opening Credits _B_  Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up!  I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.  Not so much!  Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.  There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?  Okay, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.  Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.  Happy birthday, pal!  Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.  So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er? _B_  Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it? LITTLE  Im never gonna find a roommate, ever.  Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings!  Don't cry outloud.  Yeah, baby!  Hey, it's me.  Yeah! You wanna come?  Oh, thats-thats okay, no problem.   Oh-oh-hey!  It doesn't say that. Does it?  Op, y'know what though, its kindve a girlie briefcase.  Well we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.  Okay. Bye.  It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.  Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"  Hey.  Uh, what was that? _B_  Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?  This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.  Yeah so, Tuesday?  Wouldnt it be easier if we just moved?  Lovely!

You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!  Well, Phoebe I thought IdYeah, what the hell.  Opening Credits _B_  No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I dont think they exist.  Hey Rach!  I got that!   Did I go to this school?  It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.  It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.   You bitch.  You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.  I'm not yanking you.  Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh......hi.  Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?

When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?   Smooth.  All right, theres a nuclear holocaust, Im the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?  Whats funny about that?  I didnt know you read tea leaves.  Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!  Hey!  How about Joey... Pepponi?  Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?  Wow!  I was kidding.  YOU NEVER DID IT!  We're taking a break!  Look guys, I know it's a little steep.  What're you kidding?

Happy New Year!  Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.  Yes! Way to go, man!  Still got the egg, huh? _B_  Yes?    Thank you.  Ross.  Okay.

Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, its the only chance to see New York. _B_  Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.  Okay, so weve established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we werent friends, say its a blind date. I show up at your door, and Im like  Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey.  Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.  I hope you know what Im giving up for ya, because shes not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.  Oh yeah, gym member.

Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.  Hi, Pheebs!  I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.  Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.  Yeah, Im gonna pass. Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.  Joey, why is your cable out?  Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.   Why not?  Hey thats okay. So, where do you want to go?

No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.  Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey.   This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore! Chandler and  Yes, but in Rosss case, they both know in two weeks thats it.   Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.  Uh, hey!  Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?  I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh,  this is Monica.  This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.  I was not and oh God, shh!   Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem.  Opening Credits _B_  Okaaay,  rock, hard place, me.  Hey!

So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?  Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.  Ok, this could be tough.  What just happened? LITTLE  Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, its supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh. _B_ Mr.   Put Joey on the phone.  No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called wait until the last moment before I burst and die.   Yeah, and I dont have any cologne.  B-bye!  Yknow when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?  Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure wed do nothing.  ...And what did you bring?  Oh my God, introduce us!  Dying people say the craziest things.  Oh, you do? Because she said you guys havent talked in like years.  Hey!   There are seven?!  Thats one?  Oh! Right. Umm, maybe thats because I didnt send him an invitation.  The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?   What?! I didnt even know thatWhy didnt you tell me?!  Why am I talking like this?!  Come on, dont be crazy.  You dont think theres someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya?   Thats great.  It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.   Those are all really old!  Are you asking permission to break the pact?  No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work.

Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.  Or a job where you dont have to carry a table.  Ho! Ho! Ho!  We're flipping Monica's mattress.  Dude! That's my girlfriend!  Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?  Whoa ho.  Know what I mean?  I am only one man!  Okay Ross, time is up!  Ross, a sports car? Wouldnt it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?  Again?!  Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areasand offices with fewer than fifteen people.  Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.  Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.  Well, it does not ring a bell with me...  There's a hair in my coffee.   Hey!  Oh, those places! There's always so many people, they're being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!  Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.   Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.   Hello.

Opening Credits _B_  Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.  Bye.   I cant stand the woman!   Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and...  ...now I wish I was dead.   Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?  I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.  No. When it comes to sweets, hes surprisingly strict.  Oh, whats the matter?  You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!  Janice?   Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.  Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.  Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.  Oh, yknow-yknow what, I was looking at it upside down.  I dont even know the man. Okay? Were not that close. I havent seen him in years.  Yknow I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.  Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said   What?!  I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.  Youll be perfect for this! Thats already your name!  Walter . _B_  Can you hear that?  How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!  Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's  Mrs Hannigan?   What the hell is this?  One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this. _B_  One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this. _B_  Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.  You know, I think I might just.   Excuse me?  I'm afraid I might just be.  Hi.  Umm, hows it going with you guys?  See, thats why I could never be an actor. Because I cant say gig.   Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, Im-Im talking to ah, .  This is the part where you say your name.  Well ah, ........y'know.  No!  Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.  Yes, every single one of them.  Your pants!  Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?   Huh.  What, what are you laughing at?   All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?  Theres gonna be a wedding. Youre gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.  Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean yknow you cant date him right?  Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.  They're still just friends, right?  Hes not snoozing, hes teaching a class.  No! I just happened t'do a lot trivias about smoking indifferent states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are calledLeyhallalookoos.  Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional... _B_ _B_  Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke.  Oh.. my.. God.  _B_  Might wanna try Joseph.   Awesome, the name really stands out.  You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.  Joey was in a porno movie.  Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?  No? BIG   She said yes!! She said yes!!  Awful play, man. Whoah.  Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way.  Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.   Is anybody else scared?  The abridgment.  Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind. _B_   Oh, Ill go out and get you some.  You want it? Phoebe and   Hi!  All right! Bring it on, you  Yeah, its like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!  Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personalityWell, theyre all back! Yknow? And shes picked up like nine new ones!  Maybe thats because soy-burgers suck!  Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'  No, sir.  Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter. _B_  Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?  No, no, I keep trying, yknow? I can get out, "Joey, I have too " but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, " go to the bathroom." He may think Im sick.  Yeah?   And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open. _B_   Hey, it's Janice. _B_  Well, you couldnt get them anyway. Ian doesnt play anymore and Derrick  And Derrick is a name I shouldnt know.  Our kids are gonna be fat arent they.  No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.  Well he doesnt have to know! Its not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.  So you dont have the cameras?!  Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.   There just don't happen to be any women in our games.  You like the Purple Rain display!  Hey Bob.  See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.  Anything?  Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?  Well, I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.  Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.  Ginger. Im talking to Ginger, so....  Yes, yes, its just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.  Oh no, youll have to come. _B_ Mr.  Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.  Aww, man!   Do you want us to leave the room, or?  Uhhuh, how did you know that?  Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.   Paid your phone bill?  Oh no, it's terrific, it's- it's- y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into show business.  Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.  Okay, but if you can't no dinner!  Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?  Well, only if you order stuff.  Hey Rach!  _B_  Happy Valentines!  Ha!  I havent seen this dress.  Sure.  Yes!  Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?  Dont you think its better for him to think that youre cheating on me than for him to think that I'm cheating on him? _B_ I heard it!  Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof. _B_  You know, it's funny. Every time you say "triplets," I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.   Hey you guys.  You're gonna be great.  Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!  No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.  Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?  I didn't know Monica had these!  If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.   _B_ Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.  No, I'm alright, thanks.  Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!  Nope! Because Im not your boyfriend.  Hey Pheebs, how did it go?  Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?  Jeez, at 230 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.   Oh my God! Play!   Well maybe you should put some ice on it.  Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, whos boss.  Im totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then theyre gonna go to their cast parties and hes gonna try to undermine me. Y'know itll be like, "So wheres your boyfriend, whats-his-name, Chester?" And shell go, "No-no-no, its Chandler." And hell go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"  Dont worry about it. Im taking care of it tonight.    That guy's going home with a note!  You can say that because she's not your mom.  Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence  Weirder than watching his two moms make out?   Oh, so thats this is gonna work now? Youre just gonna order me around all the time?  What?!  Hey!   Im not worried, Im uh, Im fascinated. Yknow its like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.   Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?  Hey! Hows the boat?!   Monica!   Monica  Trust me, you dont want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.  So? What? What? Theyre gone! Monicas gonna freak!  You already know. Opening Credits _B_  A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!  What does yours say Pheebs?  I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.  Hey, guys! Come on!

Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?  But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom wont let me cross the street. _B_  Nope, nope, Id just ah, Id rather talk to you.  Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.   Youre gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?  Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?  Santa pants.  Santa Clauss pants.  It's exactly like it sounds. Thanksgiving 1992 _B_  You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!  Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!  What are you smiling about? What is so funny?  OH MY GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didnt tell her we were getting married, did you?  Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.  Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.  You mean the spitter?  Yeah, he thinks thats my name.  Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?   Candy and Cookie. Candy and Cookie? Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really must love me!!   Man on  Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.  That was you?! I thought it was Jack!  I have my reasons.  Pheebs?  Alright. Ive got a plan. Ill go down the fire escape  I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.  Hey!  Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!  The one time they're not home.  _B_ I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.  Hey, kids.  Hey!  I found a dried up seashores.  All right look, Im changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.  Oh my God! That's why I got up too!  Really, bitchin!  All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?   Well, I dont have to break up with her this time. Were not involved! Im going to do a pre-emptive strike! Im going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!   That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.  What?  All right.  I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.  Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.  I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?  Dont do it.   Yeah?  Great.  I can't believe we are even having this discussion.  Nice work my friend.  Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?  Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?  You do realise that's your brother?  Emma, how old are you? How old are you today?   Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.  Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.  Ok, Phoebe.   I have no idea.  Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat? BIG  Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.  Yeah, hes really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.  Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.   Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!  Who was it?  Thats weird. I dont think my boss likes me either.  I dont think so.  You made pottery?  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right.  Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!! _B_   Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!  So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?  Did she freak out?  No reason, except she told me.  Easy for you to say Oh its been going on way to long now. Yknow, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didnt say anything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" And I-I wanted a donut. And now its five years later, the donuts gone and Im still Toby.  I love you, St. Valentine.   Bamboozled?  What?! Why does she think that?   Okay, something to cover the smell ... Ovencleaner!  Unscented!  Hear me out, woman! Ill go down the fire escape, then Ill wait for a while. Then, when I come back up the stairs, itll just be like I got back from Tulsa. Then, Joey and I will come in here and see that there is no guy in here.  What? That's terrible!  What?  Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.  You know, our band is playing on Friday.  I'm so sorry...  We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.  You understood that?  That's how radio stars escape stalkers.  Chandler. _B_  How do you not fall down more?  All right, rock on.  _B_  What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I cant have children!!   Nooo.  Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...  Hes really picky about his patients.  I thought it was $98.50.   Stop that now!   Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"   Oh, that was my work laugh.  Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.  Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you. _B_  Can you see my nipples through this shirt?  Oh, so youre already doing your part for the kids.  Sure, you guys dont have this problem, youre made of wood.  Hey!  Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?  Dude that is so sad.  Sorry, I just cant sleep. Ooh!  Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover Im like   I have no idea.  I didnt know you and Carol were getting divorced, Im sorry.  I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?  Woah, woah, thats not pretty! Man on  You really want to take me?   What?  May I?   What?  May I?  That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.  Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.  Hi!  Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.  No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page. _B_  Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.  Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think youre chances are pretty good.  All right.  _B_  Yes!  Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!  Yeah, I know that means buddy!  Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!  Oh, tell her good luck with that.  Right.  No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.  You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?  No! That would be so awkward! LookBesides, we work in different departments. Hes on the sixth floor yknow? So he calls me Toby once in a while. Whats the big deal? It could be worse, its not like hes calling me Muriel.   Who cares? Its a stupid game.  Again, what?!  No thanks, I'm good.  Just gonna wait for a little while.  Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.  Ah!  Ok, ok, here we go.  Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.   What do you think Pheebs?  Is he the one with the beautiful wife? _B_  You got it.   What? _B_ Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap.  This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir? _B_ MRS.  All right.  "My husband is sleeping with his secretary." She's married!   Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by,  Bye-bye.  Y'know, I wouldve bet good money that hed be the first one of us to get married.   Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?  I cant believe you dont know what I do for a living!  So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.   Yes. _B_  I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!"  And it starts right now!  Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.  Sure!  Just out of curiosity did she tell you how youre gonna go?  Hey-hey, is Monica here?  You look great!  Okay.  Well, its good that you finally have a place to do that.  Could I play? _B_  What?!  Ow!  _B_  There it is! So what're you gonna do?  This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.  You'll get one.  Yeah! Im just pretending to watch the game so I dont have to help out with stuff.   No!  So youre never actually going to pay me back?  I'll tell you what. For the rest of our lives, I'll be careful, until told otherwise. _B_  Okay Buckwheat!  If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!   Joe...  I was in the car with Nancy all day.  Damn it.  Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.   Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.  It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...   And then Tineals.  I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now?  Og-ee-op, Im not asking for me, Im I mean No, Im-Im not gay, Im not asking you out. Im not-Im not-Im not gay!  Diet soda.  Hey, yknow what, if youre gonna do that, if youre gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.  Oh, come on! Chandlers funny, sophisticated, and hes very loveable, once you get to know him.  Well, what did the police say?  It is starting to get dark out there.  Yeah lets head off to work.  Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore _B_  Im not macho.  Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the "a-gogo."  Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didnt agree to that!   You said no, right?  Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.  Sorry, I just dont like the idea of when I say "I do," hes thinking, "Yeah, Id do her too!"  Shh! It is a family name!  I dont suck. Its sucks. You suck.  Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever!  Woman on  Luckily, the guy she settled for cant hear what youre talking about.  Well, Im sure you get another one at Ann Taylors.  As we all are at some point during the day.   Right. You know what? Actually I just getoff the plane, so I'm feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take ashower.  Wait a minute. This isn't the china we picked out...  Its huge! _B_ _B_  Well, now, I actually have to get to work.  Here we go. Stand up straight.  Big smile.   Ok.  Yeah.  Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.  Wait, wait, wait. _B_ _B_  Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. _B_  I can't believe she's married.  Sure. Ummm. Whats up?  That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.  Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I dont belong here."  Okay.   Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.  No-o-o!  No?  No-o-o! Look Joey, heres the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, Im gonna be moving out man.  Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yknow? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!  so then the farmer says, "Thats not a cow and youre not milking it."   Oh, are we playing this?!  You okay over there?  Centerpieces!  And your friend Phoebe?  All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?   OK, so now we draw cards.  Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.   And a bagel with only  No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!   Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!   Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!  Fine!  Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!  Fresh!  So, basically just a Chinese guy.  It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.  Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.  We dont, really.  Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?  See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.  Orange juice.  Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, hell be there. And hell bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that youre really hot.  Condoms?  Ross, it's just a sandwich!  So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!  Oh hi!  No, I guess I just never really cried. Yknow? Im not a crying kind of guy.  Okay, look I need your help, I dont know what to get her for Valentines Day.  Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.  You said no, right?!  Yeah!  I am trying! _B_  You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and youre still gonna date him?  I always knew you were gonna make it. Im so proud of you.  Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?   Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance.  Bye-bye.  Oh God!   Alright, the truth is, I soiled myselfduring some turbulences.  Why?  Okay.  That's what our friends call us.  You're kidding!  Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?  I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . _B_ Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. _B_ That's actually good. _B_  We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.  What gay thing?  Hello.   Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?  Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.  Yeah, its two guys in a ring, and the rules  Is it on?  You mean like, music? _B_  Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!   Okay.  But it is officially nighttime.   Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Lets discuss it before we reject it completely."  Look at us, were a couple of couples!  Hey! Howd the audition go?  Oh, dont worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody. _B_  Definitely roses.  Well, I just think theyre a little more weddingy.  But Lilies are the clear choice.  Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it? _B_  Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.  _B_ Dr.  Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.  Yeah! Anderson just scored again!  Theres no Anderson.  Why do you want to play this game so bad?  I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.  Well Joey, Im a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin!   No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too.  Oh, Satan's minions at work again...  See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.  Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!

Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club.  Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.  Hi!

So, uh, wh-where ya from?  Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, Im rich!  What do you think, shes just gonna sit there quietly? You dont think shes gonna want to make a toast?

Before we go out there Ive got a present for ya.  Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesnt it? _B_   Yeah well, Im gonna go spit.   Well, what did she say?  Oh, uh..

But, those are for you. _B_  So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?  So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid!

You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.  Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at bigger rocks.  Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?  Which is why Asteroids is perfect! Its the oldest game!  Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!   Nothing, I just like to go like this.    Would you put that back on?! Monicas gonna be here any minute!   Uh, uh.   Monica! Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, I appreciate you getting me the costume  Who says you cant get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks?

Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend  and her brother,  I cant do that we promised wed make each other gifts this year.  So it did go well.  Yknow what? Its gonna be okay. Yknow what? Shes probably not gonna even want to come.   Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?   I cant seem to say goodbye.  No?  Does Ross know?  mmm That's enough about you!  Wow.  You don't like him.  You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!

Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...  Hey.  Look, I just dont think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Yknow? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Yknow? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?  Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben.  Do you know what Pheebs? When youre done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.   That's OK.  And monkeys cant write out prescriptions.   Nothing!  Oh-oh, what are you doing?   You are beautiful.  Hey, I can be smooth.  Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.  Maitre d' Of course, sir.   Okay, everybody stay here.

That’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady. _B_  I don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy’s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.  Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.  I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled.  I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place! Joey  You know, I had a chance to stop her too!  Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.  Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery? RACHEL AND  I'll cancel the sodas. _B_  Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic.

When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.   So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.  I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped! _B_  Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!   Nice!  Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio  So what happened?  I can't smell your sandwich?  Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.   You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.  Why would our guy be a weirdo?  And  to you too, Helen.  Okay.    No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.  You are so great! I love you!   Oh hey. Id shake your hand but uh; Im really into the game.

Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant! Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!  I just feel awful.

Alright babe, deal the cards.   When have I ever done that?!  Dont try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!  Well, Im not really in a sexy mood right now.  This is so exciting! Its so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?  Okay, so this time I won't quit!  You got it!  We don’t. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.  Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.  Heh.  Whoever stood you up is a jerk.  Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?  Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.  Yeah I just... wanted to call and say hey.  Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.  So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?  Um-mm, yeah right!  Okay, so I guess thats about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.  Okay, okay, but dont worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which Im fairly certain are the same thing.  Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.  Too many jokes... must mock Joey!   Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!  Arghhhhhh!!   Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.  Okay, I'll give them back.  Look! What is so great about that sandwich?  Yeah, I think we should see other people.   What?  What?   What? What can't you do?  So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.  Well, it is overdue.  Who are you going out with?  Okay.  The  Oh, okay. Send her in.   Had the money in the wrong hand.  _B_  Thats correct. _B_  Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!  What the fuck are you doing?! _B_  Honey, Im gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case.  Get there faster!  _B_  OK, Pheebs, your turn.  Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?  Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but...  you know, you and Monica have the same "I'm gonna kill you" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her...   Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but...  you know, you and Monica have the same "I'm gonna kill you" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her...   Tell me more.  Yes, Joe?  He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.  Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap  Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.  Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.  I know, that,  that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.  No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.  Well, I didnt do anything. I didnt want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.   Uhh, that was Joey. Hes running a little late, he says hes sorry.   Hello.   Its Gandolf!!!  So, are you in town?   Oh, well, well maybe next time then.   No, hes right, Im totally lying.    Elizabeth Hornswoggle?  Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things.  Are you okay?  I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And yknow Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around   Hey, look at all the boxes!  Oh well, that makes it not terrible.  Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!  Here you go.    Hey!  Fine.  Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?  Yeah, thats kinda a relief.  What?  Yep. Ms.  All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.   You'll get one.  I know. Gooooood luck with it. _B_  Your hands are shaking.  Forget about her.  I don't know.  I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?   Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.  _B_ Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK. _B_ MR.  That's right my friend. It's time for...  Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?  ...Hm.  Oh yes, and thats what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.  Hey, shut up!! Youre not my real Mom!! _B_  Hey!   Okay, we have to talk. Im just getting out of a very serious relationship  Aah, y'killing me!   No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.  Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!  _B_  I'm over here big guy.  What do you mean, like, buy it together?  Yeah, it is the best.  Okay.  Yes.  Hes at a dinner party.  Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.  Oh no problem, maybe Ill play with my left hand.  No, I am.  Hi, Nina. Come on in.  No I didn't!  Well, if were gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Yknow alphabetically or by genre?  Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow .   You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!   You have to really wanna see it. _B_  ...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!   Bye. _B_  Alright you guys are off to party number one _B_ and you, you are off to party number two _B_ Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.  Hello-dillillio!!  Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not. _B_  Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.  So I guess its just uh, you and me then.  Hes not gonna make it, hes stuck in Chicago.  Well, Kathys last boyfriend was Joey.  Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken. Mrs.  Horn-swoggle.  Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.  Y'know, I don't see that happening?  Okay, Im a rookie. I should not be in the end zone. _B_  Tell me it's "you and me" we.   This, this actually is a   Thats sweet.  Yes!  Well, thanks a lot for hookin me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.   I dont think you did a very thorough job!   Love you.  How long it took to go back in the water?  You wanna see if we still have it?  Its just so glamorous. _B_   Yes. Ms.  What?  Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.  You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness   All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?  Course there, they just call it food.  No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.  _B_  It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.  So, we gettin' a fish?  You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car _B_.  What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?  Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!   Okay, but after that, were shootin some pool.  Okay.  Its a chicken.  I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.   Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.  You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?   You did look like an idiot.  You think we're ready for something like that?  Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.  Yeah.  It's a great idea.   Thats the way I did it til I was 19. _B_  No not okay, you cant look for Monicas presents!  Yeah!  A face ass?   Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy! _B_  Does anybody know me?!   I do?   Uh, Yes. Yes. Ive just been going over your data here, and little thing, youve been post-dating your Friday numbers.  No I didn't!  My God! You must be good in bed!  Im watching the game, but Im not deaf!  Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.   Hey Phoebe!  Fatty!  See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes.  Me.  We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.  Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.  I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.  Ok, they're coming, shhh. _B_  Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.  Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between em.  All right, theres a nuclear holocaust, Im the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?  She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?  Yeah, I think it is!  Stupid, useless Canadian money! _B_ Mr.  No, Im afraid I wont be able to make love as well as him.   Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?  Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.  Love what you've done with the place.  No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before.   What's going on?   Hi.  Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'   Hey.  All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?  Ok, you can not do this to me.  Was his question whats more boring than him?  Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentines Day gifts?  Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman? Fireman #1 Well uh, do either of you smoke?  Ross!  So uh, what did this woman look like?  Yes!!   "Happy Birthday Peehe."   Well, whats the deal with these? These-these look nice.  What?  Hey.  Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years.  If! I said, "If it helps!"   You dont know. You didnt see it.  FREE PORN!!!  Yeah?  Yes dear.  Sure! Alright...  Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.  This is like figure skating team all over again.  I mean synchronized swimming.  I mean- I mean the balance beam.  Help me!  Yuh-huh.  I think they get it.  Thank you Rachel.  Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good  Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?   Take off your shirt!   Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.   Hello, children!  I hear ya.  But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!  Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?  Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?  Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.  Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our  anniversary.  No, you dont have to, and you cant because I live here too.  Okay .   And he's not speaking metaphorically.  Okay.   Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.  Joey! Joe!  Full bag.  Beers still cold. Something terrible mustve happened here!  Oh no-no-no-no-no-no!  Stevie, I was never here!  _B_  No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!  _B_   What?  Well, I got a job interview. Its kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and Id be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.  And, a lemon lime.  Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?  Why not?  Well, we are great guys.  Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Bleeth?  Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin out the Chan-Chan man!  Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.  Ive got canned goods.  No, I don't.  Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut  Yes, and I was saying the actual words.  Hi! Hi! Youre crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.  Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.  Hey!   Yes, you got something from the Screen Actors Guild.  Hey!  Now imagine you live at the supermarket.  Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.  Do we have to make the entire thing?  No-no-no-no.  Hey!   Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?  Okay, heres the thing. Were gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that youre drunk.  You mean like for award shows?  Yknow I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?  Sex on the balcony?  Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful?   We have free porn here!!! _B_  Okay.  I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?  No, no, no.  Oh my God!  Thank you.  Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?  There's the man.  The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice.    Have I got the 50 guys for you!  No! No! Not, Paris.  Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there?   Forget it! Okay, Im not giving up the apartment.  I know I am. Mrs.  Oh yeah!  Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!  Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.  I'm not moving out.  Oh, I wish Id know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.  Why?  No, our guy is just a floating head.  WENUS.  Weekly Estimated Net...  Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.  Me! I do that. So Seriously, do I look okay? Im little nervous.  And last but not least.   What?!  That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!  I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice. _B_  Yes, Bunny?  See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind. _B_  You think?  Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.  Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. Ill do it.  Excellent hole, Joe.   and then it got canceled.  We share a wall! So either hes great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.  Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie. _B_   "Benefits lapsed."  No-no  I hope she throws up on you.   Ehh.  Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.  God, its great to catch up! I cant believe how long its been!  No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive  Hold on one second; let me check this out.  Okay uh, is that her?    Am not! _B_  Yeah, Ill take care of it.  Hey!  You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "Who are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"  Well, what if all my stuff was here?  Whats this?  Shes okay with Rachel and the baby?  What is it?  See, honey, theres  Okay. Ive been thinking about it too, and I, I think were ready.  Thanks, man.   Uh, uh.  Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.  Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?  Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.  Sorry. Im sorry. Y'know what, were just gonna throw it.   Easy Lenny. _B_  Thank you, Ross.  Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! Theyre buying me drinks! Theyre giving me stuff!  Knicks tonight?  Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?  Yemen. Thats right, yes, Im being transferred to Yemen!  Like what?   Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.  Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...  Hey!    Oh, good. Rog is here.  Shocking! Since you still have the keys.  Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?  No, I have a great idea for a present for her.  So...  Theres a Mr. Bing!  Dont worry about it Pheebs.  Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?  Its not just that shes cute, okay. Its just that... shes really really cute.  I dont know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful, great questions.  The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...  They were just giving those away at the store  in exchange for money.  What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.  Noho. Who doesn't they like me?   We're teeth people Zack! _B_  Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...   Hey, look at this. "My Big Book of Grievances."  Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way. _B_  Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?  Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?   What if Joey were president?   Yes.  Yes!  Really?! You do that?  Yeah?  I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.  Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.  Okay, its not a check. Theyre saying your health insurance expired because, you didnt work enough last year.   What?   Oh thats great! Good for you.  Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.  Dont worry, Im brave! I am brave! I I am brave!  No-no-no-no!!   Can you tell me who is there please? The   Okay we have to do something about your breath.  Yknow Im-Im really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.  Okay, who wore those?   Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what Im saying? _B_   Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowersThink of the money well save!!  Were not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?  See? I told you.  Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that youre going down the same path, but youre really going down different ones.  Honey, I dont like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?  Why not?  Really? What?  Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!    Monica. Calm, self.   Ooooh.   There you go. _B_  Yeah.   Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.  Oh my God! Oh my God!  All right.  Wherever! Ive got like 20!  I dont know exactly.  I said, "Like what?"  Oh my God!  The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.  It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.  Yeah, I wanna go to babe.  Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or  What equity investments?  Yes it would. What do you say to $50?  Oh, what a crappy night!   Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.  Secret? Married people arent supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.  Huh! Where is the dog?!  Did you see Betty?  _B_ Mr.  What are you talking about?   I don’t... uh... understand.  Hmm, the game's at one.  April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.   Could've been a peach.  Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? _B_ Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? _B_ OK, that's my bad.  Janices birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.  What time is it now?  No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!  Dog grooming huh? Okay, just dont make my tail too poofy. _B_  Oh, the tears are real. _B_   Sounds like a fun party.  Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.  All right.  If I help, we can find em faster!  Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm  Can you hold for one second please?  What?!  An old cookie?   No, were still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.  Thats still yours. Okay, now remember its a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.  No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.  Yknow I was thinking if we had a a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours  Not bad.  Oh my God.   Yknow we already went over this and I won!   What?   Yknow, its been a while since weve screamed something. Maybe we should.  Well, this does butch it up a bit.  Whats wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?  On a barbecue chicken pizza?  No?  What about it?  But you said you were ready too.  Can I use your phone?   Oh yeah?  Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart right out.  Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.   Yeah.   And now Ive picked it up again.   Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!  All right.  Yknow what, Im gonna uh, play the field just a little more.  But I do know that its some time tomorrow. _B_  Okay, great.  Hotel  I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.  Aw, don't do that _B_ Phoebe's  Come on, Rach.  Okay, lets play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.  _B_  Excuse me.  How ya doin'?  I could use the money No Im serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.  What?  I can't belive it.  I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.  Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.  I know, I hate being left out of things.  Why would you say that?  Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.  Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?  Thats a good idea, Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday. I would like to get her something serious.  Yeah all right, so well hang out.  Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?  Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.  Okay.   I wanna quit the gym. Gym  Well, thanks. I grow it myself.  Yknow who also has great hair is Joey!  You do know that Wham broke up?  Hey ladies! What are you in here for?   Im sorry man, theres never a good time to  stop catching on fire.  You dont even have a car!   Hi! Im back.  Yeah, that sounds great.  Okay. Well, well do it then.  Okay, bye-bye.   Well, cause she came back the third summer and shed gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow  Okay.   Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!  Whos that?  Okay!  Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought  Wait a minute, I-I can do this.  I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you,  you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.  And if youll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.  Monica, will you marry me?  Look forget it okay? I dont want to go. I dont want to see him. I dont wanna.  Oh honey, leave them alone, theyre in love.  So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?  Oh come on!  All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?   What?!  Yes, but havent you wanted a kid like forever?  Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?   Funniest guy she's ever met!  I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes...  Save it for inside!    Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!  But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.  Okay, the old hug and roll.  Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.  Guys are signing over their 401-Ks to me?  Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!  Ow!   Hey!  Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats! _B_  Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?   He took my joke, he took it.  Okay!  We cant accept this.  Oh no-no, I cant do that.  Joe   Okay. Heres a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.  Wow! I dont have the worst costume anymore!  Honey! Thats crazy! I dont want you to get me a stripper  They do me?  On every word?  You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.   Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?  Who said anything about Christmas? _B_  OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. _B_ Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . _B_ wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there. _B_  All right. Look, Im gonna go in here, and you dont buy me anything ever.   Yes. Vividly.  I wanna quit the gym. Gym  What-what cha doin?  All right, all right, Ill go sleep with my girlfriend. But Im just doing it for you guys. _B_  Raymond Chandler.  What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular. _B_  Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?  Gary, I'm here to report a crime.  Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.  And?  Whoa, snowing out there? Mr.  Hi.  Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store weve been too and I cant find the perfect ring!  Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring!  Its a beautiful selection.   I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow "  Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!   400 A.M.  Thats me! Come on!  Pierce Brosnan?  No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, youd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Yknow its hard enough to be fourteen. Youre skinny. Youre wearing speedosThat your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and theres your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. He was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!  She mustve been planning this for years!  Are you serious?!  Hey!  Hey!   She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?  Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.  Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!  Okay, one question.  No, no, no, actually losers rhyme. _B_  Hes right. Nobodys gonna benefit, and youre just gonna hurt her.  Weve got to do something!  It just doesnt feel like were breaking up.   Yes.  Okay, theres this one guy, Patrick, I think youre gonna like him, hes really nice, hes funny, hes a swimmer.  Where is Emily?  What? Why?  Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.   Art lover!   You did.   What gave me away?  You got it. Good woman!  Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?  You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? Im going to get a joke journal. Yknow? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.  All right!   Our guy has great hair.  Cause its gross.  Okay.   So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?   Yes, include more people in this.   All right, this isnt so bad. I like the flower smell! Which is okay, because Ive got my boat.  Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...  Hey Joe!  I don't sound like that.  Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?  Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!  No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.  Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon. _B_  I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . . _B_ _B_ MR.  But...  Why not?!   Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!!  You wanna go shotgun?  Yeah, I-I-I think so.  Yeah, I-I think so...   I wanna quit the gym. Gym  Kay.  All right, I'm nine years old.  Okay, there are no famous Joeys. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.  Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen. _B_ Mrs.  Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.  If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?  It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.  There you are. _B_   We didnt get to the audition. Im gonna take her to coffee and then well do it then.   Take whatever you want, just please dont hurt me.  Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?  What is it doing here?  I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work!   He does not know that I am not some of us.  Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.  Are you serious?  He had sex with Mr. Garibaldi!  Honey, isnt it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?  Look, I appreciate it, but uh, its a little creepy. Yknow? Im not a bachelor anymore.  What is it that I do?  So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state.  And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.  Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?  What happened?  Great!  This baby'd better be really good. _B_  Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!  Hey, how's the first day goin'?  You're pretending the pillow's a girl right? _B_  Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.  Okay.  Yes.  Uh, cant you wait until tomorrow?  All right.  Unbelievable!!  Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.  Man, didnt she like just get here?  No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!  I said art lover.  Okay, so thats it, everybody knows! Its official, were moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?  That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy.  I've always wanted to know... _B_  Yeah!  Our guy smells incredible.  Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?  "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."  So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, were on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.  Well, thank you for lunch.  Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.  Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.  Oh my God.  Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.   Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.  And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?  No reason.  _B_  Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!  What is the thing?   Hike! Monica and  Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?  Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?  All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timings right. And thats what deathbeds are for.  Thanks.   Oh the phone! The phones making sounds!  Hello!  I walk into a room and he wont even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.  We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.  Wh-wh-why?!  I gotta check out this hot girl!  There she is!  _B_  Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.  Yknow when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you dont, you dont do that every year do you?  Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.  Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.  Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget.  Seriously, good luck marrying me. _B_  Hey, where you been?  007?! This is James Bonds tux?!  Does it matter?!  So, shouldnt we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go snooping around her crotch?  What are you doing?!   Did you like me when we first met?  I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.   And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.  What?  So what does this mean?  Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?  So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?   Okay.  And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!  Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?  Where are they? Where are they?  Well there you go.  Well, then, I might as well offer to stay. _B_   There he is!  See, Im not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?  Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, hell never be President. Theres never gonna be a President Joey.  Easy tiger.  Uh-huh.   Well it's not flexed right now! _B_  I don't know, I'm very tired.  Wow that was my scariest voice! Youre very brave.   Picking Rachel.  Honey, it is not a date! I havent talked to her in ten years! You cant just call up somebody you havent talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, yknow? You gotta, you got to put in some time.  Hey.  Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.  Okay, we owe you a present.  No, he visited a little town south of throw up.  So what was Phoebes secret?  Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!  So apparently we just dont pay for food anymore.  Do you see what I see?   Yknow, we havent found anybody else.   Hi! Nice to meet you!  Well you dont have to sound so surprised.  We are on our honeymoon.  Im going to need a bigger boat. _B_  Whats wrong with you?  She answered.  And that would have made the official party line.  Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.  I mean, you have a lovely home.  Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon.  I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?   What?  Oh, hey.  She was kidding.  Okay.    I wanna quit the gym.  Hey its Joey!  Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse. _B_  Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!  How do you figure that?  Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!  You dont, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything? Phoebe and  No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.  Young! Youre a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybodys ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!  Score.  How do you know so much about this?  Oh, I have to get married in James Bonds tux!  Yeah o-okay, but Im just doing this for you.  Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?  All right fine! But Im only doing this for you!  I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!  Will power? I've watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs without taking the tin foil off.  What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken?  See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?  Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.   Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?   M-Me, me, me!  Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting!   It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.  Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?  Y'know what, hes right. Theres something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.  Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.  Wow, youre, youre right. I have a horrible, horrible name.  So what are you going to do?   Yeah.  Hey.  Maybe its the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.  No, we only went out once.  Well, you dont look good Joe.  But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny story  Youre roommate in college died didnt he?  Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you hold out that ring and ask me to marry you? Male  Thats it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?   Really?  Mm! Night Gar!  _B_  Mrs. Braverman must be out.   What?  This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-youGo to the doctor!  This is ridiculous, hes not gonna hold his breath   I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.   You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!  I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?  No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!   What? What do you mean you know?  Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.    Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!   Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!   OK, this one right here is from me.  What did you just do?  Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.  So whaddya got there Monica?  What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.   Well she, she wouldnt do that, shes with, shes with me.  Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.  She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.   Well hes probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.  Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.  Im getting dressed.  What?  Hey Joe.  Im right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now theres no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!  I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! Im right. I'm right. Am I right?  Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.  You mean scared.  Because thats where Joey gave me some stuff to store that Ive never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!  _B_  Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.  Joe?  Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err...   Richard used to do it, didn't he?  Yeah you can do it.  Oh, its not just that, I would be Englands most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majestys secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill.  Would Monica let me wear this? _B_  So I really never get to win anymore?  Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?  And Joey.  'kay,  Yeah, he came up...  No, come on, you know that's not true.  That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!  _B_  You know what? You don’t need a thesaurus, just write from here,  your full sized aortic pump. _B_  Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.  . Well played.   Here we go.  Weird world. Your kids?  All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?  ....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!  Well, thats the best kiss Ive had with anyone Ive ever met in a mens room.  Its a big company, I dontif youI  Okay.  I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you. _B_  What are you doing?  Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap.  Seriously.  You know Oh My God.  Not once!  Thats still in there?!   Oh my God thats it, thats the ring! How much is it?  Well, it still has to go, right? Monica and  By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake.  Honestly? Me too.  Hey! Did you find the cameras?  Let me see that.  Why?  I don't do that.   Oh! Right.  Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout.  Phoebe is going to say "yes"? That's, that's great!  Phoebe is going to say "yes"? That's, that's great!  Hey.  What?  Yeah, well, youre wrong! Okay, youre wrong.  Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there....   Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issacs sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebes friends with Rachel. And thats the trail, I did it! _B_  I know.  When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.  Okay.  Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!  Why?  Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.  Sure, I'll do it with ya.  Okay. It's not different at all, is it?  Scared? Happy?  Ok, well, this was very special.  Yes, we were just    Well.... it is amouz-ing...   Uh, youve had a lot of sex right?   Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!  Aww!   Mustached bastard  Yeah.  Ill be right with you. _B_  Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech?  "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"  Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.   Were you there?  I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?  Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.  Hey!  Is it really that bad?  Is it really that bad?  Hey, Janice.  Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.  Well, we could count again.  Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.  Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.  Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.   So ah, isnt a bit cold out for shorts?  Um, is it sugarless?   Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.  What?  Well sensitive is important, pick him.   Sure...  Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?  Are you serious?   Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!  You built a fort didn't ya?  Well, I-I still think youre very-very nice and very pretty  Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, yknow Ive always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father. Mr.  Is this a service youre providing me?  Okay, it's um  Well, we dont want that.  Yeah. Yknow I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and Ill go all Chandler. But nothing has.  Yes! And thats why Im under the table. Celebrating.  I dont think the flash went off.  Triscadecaphobia.  You forbid me?  But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.  Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.  And there's not chance that will work?  And there's not chance that will work?  Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?  Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?  Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband.  'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.   Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.  What is it?  Oh yeah man.  Joey.    Okay. Mrs.  Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.  Let them win one.  Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.   I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!  Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this ones free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third ones free.   Really.   Oh thats great, my friend Joeys in the movie business.  Well, its just the reason that Im asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable toI mean I really wanted to, but I couldnt . There huhhmm, there-there was an incident.  What about him?   Excuse me... _B_ Male  I  I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.  Today is the sixth.  Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.  Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?  Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!  Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?  Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.  Eh, y'know what, shes to political, she probably wouldnt let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.   Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?  Oh no, no, no, no.  Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.   Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental  Yeah, were gonna have to get you out of those shoes.  Beam me up Jesus.  I don't know... um, Grease?  Because youve only known her for six weeks! Okay, Ive got a carton of milk in my fridge Ive had a longer relationship with!  Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?   Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was    All yours babe.    Hes the headliner of a gay burlesque show. _B_  Janice is gonna go away now.  Our new fridge? I dont live here anymore.  Oh yeah, I should probably call them. Mr.  But we should take it.  Okay. Ill be right there.   Well this is great. Yknow, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, shes really depressed.  25J and K, any chance those arent together? _B_  You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is shehere by the way?  Fine, I'll give the suit back.   Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that!    Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!   Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!  That's great.  Can I see the book?   Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.   What did you just do?  Okay, I'll do it!  Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.  Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer.  See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.   Im up! Im up, Ive gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?  Well it you dont know that, then I dont want to do this with you. _B_  So thats the girl you like.  Ah-ha, youre not the boss of me.  Yeah, you are!  Ooh, saucy.  Yeah. Yes! Yeah.   Yknow uh, you didnt really have to help me pack.  I happen to know a Fun Bob.  Okay, I'll stop.  You're not even giving them a chance!  Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.  Were you're parents happy, or something?  Hey.   My friends name is Joey.  Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.  Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000. Male  Its happened to you?  Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?   I have to! Okay? It's time!  Okay, I hate dogs.   Ahh-hahaha!  _B_  Fear of Triscuts?  Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.   Yes, it's also 2003.  Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.  Me too.  You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?  Oh, because we love kids. Love ‘em to death.Well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.  You are going downer!  I'm okay.  I'm okay.  Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her. _B_  What?  Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.  Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there. _B_  Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know shes too international, y'know shes never gonna be around.  Hi Joeys sisters!  No, really youre gonna freeze.  Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.  Big bullies!!   Rent?  And I love the milk! But, Im not gonna some British girl to move in with me!  Joey, you say things now.  Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?  I hate this thing!   Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants?  Someone comment on the pants!  Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.  Hey.  Uh-huh.  Oh, I dont think I ever heard that story.  Why?  I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. Its called being a good conversationalist. Watch.  Say something.  All my energy is going into not asking that question. I cant believe I screwed this up!  Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.  Thats still in there?!  Hello sir, you know Monica. _B_  Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?  Santa? Really?  Oh ok.  This vacation sucks!! _B_  This vacation sucks!! _B_  Oh, that's Ross's.  Wow, he looks so normal.  Look, are you gonna be ok?  Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.  All right, I have to get that, but no-no.  Hello?   Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that.  Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred?  So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?  Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?  _B_  Me too!!  Youll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.  You are, youre gonna leave me like this?  Oh.   Fears and Pet Peeves.  Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!  Hey Phoebe!  Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.  So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.  Yeah, Ive always hated that Howie.  No, the little girl creeps me out.  Well, whatd you do?  Were the Bings.   Thank you. Mrs.  What?  It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.  Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!?   I wouldn't know, I didn't make it!  _B_  Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.  Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.   What... did you get me there?  So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody whos gonna be in the country like all the time.  Youre not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?  Wait a minute, wait a minute, you dont like the guy Rachels dating? Well, thats odd. _B_  Okay, so when do you want to go?  Hey! Im sorry! That where are you going?  Do not speak ill of the dead.  Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.  Fat  You wanna play?  Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro?   Please let them win!  Yeah, what was wrong with your old human teeth.  Oh, good, Joey's home now.  What?!   Okay  Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!  _B_  Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?   Whats wrong?  Then, I might as well ...  do this . Not really sure what to do now.  Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?  Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.   Yeah  I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.  That's what we were gonna name the baby.  Yeah, didn't he tell ya?  Well, actually just one birthday flan.  Hey!  Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.  No, no, no, no, no!   Okay Ross, why dont you come with me?   Hi.  Hey!  Y'know, I, I really dont think we need a canoe.  Okay. But if you dont come back soon,  theres pretty much nothing I can do about it! _B_  No-no-no-no, this is bad! Its bad! This is bad!  Oh yeah! With who?  Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly youre having sex with him.  Oh, Im packing. Yknow Im-Im packing cause Im moving to Yemen tomorrow.  What is going on here?  Hmm.  Here you go.  Now stop bringing us pizzas you.  Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!  Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.  Hi.  OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man.  Joe?  Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack.   The nerve huh?  Why would the baby creep me out?  Uh, credit card.  Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey.  Okay, Ill go get it. You guard the ring.  Let me see this guy.  W-H-Wow! Dont show this to Monica! And dont tell her about the W-H-Wow! _B_   What? What? What?  Mr. and Mrs. Bing!   Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so. Dennis  Stick to your side!  This game makes no sense!  Tough crib.  I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?  Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !  Funniest? Heckles?  Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.  How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?  Oh, come on, theres a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.  And youre our age. Youre our age.  Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?  I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.  Okay, what is in here? Rocks?  Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.  Oopsey, missed it!  Hi, Joe.  Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.  Okay, are you aware unagi  is an eel?  What a sweet story.  Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!  Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?  I've had a very long, hard day.  Are you serious?  Oh dont forget, my office holiday party is tonight.   Then it's okaaay!  _B_  Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.  Hey, you must be Owen.  I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.  But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.  Wow!  Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?   Wow!  You hear that? We're the guys.  Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to. BIG  It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee. _B_  Of!  Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!  Roberts coming out.  Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?  Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.  All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!  Yes, it is, at Office Max.  Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?  Yeah.  Im only going to pretend Im moving to Yemen, its the only way I can get rid off her.  Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go. _B_  That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight.  Maybe there's something in that area.   Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.   You're welcome.   Yeah, you're right about that. _B_   Happy plane-aversary.  Rach  Hi, listen, Im sorry about before. I dont need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldnt get girls, and now I can emNow, I have you.  Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women   Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.  Refill? _B_  You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76.  Amouz-bouche?  _B_  They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.  Hey Bob.  Oh come on Ross, I think were all losers here.  Fine. What!?  You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your familys. It's bad enough that we're working new year's eve.  Did I not tell *anyone* about new year's eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go.   I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.  What?  So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?  Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I.  He was right. Would you listen to that?  I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.  No, no, no, no, no, no  No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday.  I can't believe it.  That's great.   Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.  Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam.   Oh, Im taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer. Joeys  Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.  Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.  Okay, but this is the last time.  With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.  Bored and bored!  What?!  Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!  Does for me.   I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn." _B_  So, rocks.   I'm intrigued.   Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!   I cant figure out what to make Monica.  Oh come on guys, its not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it werent for  Monicas allergies.  Youre right, I could never lie to you. She hates you.  Should I get that?  Hello?  Uh no, Joeys not here right now. Can I take a message?  Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 500 to 230?  Okay great.  Bye.   This is going in your book?  Thank you Gunther, put it there.  Definitely not easier with coins.  Thank you.  Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.  Marriage advice? Really?!  Now sweetie, I know you dont like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a supple leather lining.  I wasnt trying to open your closet! I wasnt trying to open your closet! I swear!   Good, God's speed, good people!  You're not gonna go?  I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.  What?  Very informative!  Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?  You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?  I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.  No. He.....hes coming out of his shorts.  You're watching a football game at a funeral?  A pen.  Okay!  Oh come on!!   That new mountain bike?  Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.  What?  Can I give you a present now?  I dont know. But I-I-I know I love you!  Really?  Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.  Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monicas gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?  If I see him, Ill ask.  You are not going to believe what I did today!  Let me think. Let me thinkOh! I dont care.  If it helps, I could slide over.  You serious?   I am not working. There's not much to do around here! _B_  What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?   No, I just had to get a picture of this.   Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?   What stupid thing did you do?  Whoa!  Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you? _B_  Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.  Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay. _B_  Volleyball.  Hes right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.  No-no-no-no, no, its a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why cant we savor the precious moments?  Those are some huge breasts you have.   Y'know what, pretty good.  Hey.   I-kea! This is comfortable.  Oh my God! If you say that one more time, Im gonna break up with you!  Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that Ill stop seeing her?  Yknow, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know youre up there every night, youre naked, touching, kissing.  Yeah.  Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.  Long!  _B_  He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!  No, no no no. Youll be fine.  Hillarys bind, right?  Im going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?   Am I naked again?!   Is there a puppy here?  Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.  Hi. Mrs.  I dont know, Monica picked out the flowers.  No.  Why not?  Monica has a secret closet and she wont let me see whats in it.  Well, youre forgetting about the time difference. _B_  Ah. Thanks.  ...Take off their hats!  Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.  I see you later!  end Crazy For Friends is best viewed at 800x600 with Internet Explorer 6.0.

A beautiful little baby! And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.  That's it?  No, Janice.  It doesn't scare me!  The man is showing brain.  Thats not a state Joe.  You are a frightening, frightening man.   Huh-huh! You can't give her that.  Ooh! Yes! Okay! Heres what we do, we-we forget it happened.  No thank you.  I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.  Okay!  Oh man! Dont tell me I did this!  So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.  Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know? Commercial Break _B_  Ohh.  Oh yes!  Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?  Oh totally!  Pull my finger. _B_  I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler.  Although I-I hope they dont.  Either, it makes no difference.  Right, fine, I'll do it, but no talking.  Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?  Hey, how'd the interview go?   ahem... um... Crystal duck.  Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modelers club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.  Okay.  What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?  Okay, stop.  Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you. GIRL'S  Because, Im too afraid.  To yourself.  Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.  Good! I havent smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.  She?  Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!  His legs flail about as if independent of his body!  Well, you can understand, given how we started.   Okay.  Joey, trade lives with me!  No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your  adult film class.  Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?  Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it.   Fine.   Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!  Theyre not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!  Yeah.   Well its kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that hes not real.  Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.  Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?   Okay, you are new!  Hey Pheebs!  Hey Joe!   Mom. Thanks for wearing something.   Mrs.  She picked those out too.  Just act like you belong.  Yeah! Mr.  Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?  I dont know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I cant see?!  Thats right. Your husbands home, so now the sex can stop. _B_  Ah.  Chandler Bing. _B_  You know how to use a compass?  Well, that's spongy.  Well, that's spongy.  What am I gonna do, huh? _B_  Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.  You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?  Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...  Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!!  Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.  Commercial Break _B_   Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna..  Hi, Im Chandler.  Look, Ross, you have what you want, youre back with Rachel. If you bring this up now youre gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.  Hi!  How are you?  s office.  Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!  Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means were unhappy forever. Sound good?  Hey, man!  Flashdance.  Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we cant leave in the small apartment after weve lived here! Didnt you ever read Flowers for Algernon?  What?!  Thank you for that!  I was not flirting.  How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?  Yes, we dont get married unless theres a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight  then theres a definite sign that we should get married.  Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.  Thats a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.  Okay.  Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some coleslaw, some beans, and a CokeDiet Coke.  _B_  Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the board! High five!   Ill take a card.  Hello? Hello?   And no kissing your neck.  Enunciate!  Hey Joe!  You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.   F-hah.... flennin....  I just think it's weird, you know?  Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles  Would you knock it off?   Bah!  Commercial Break _B_  That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!  Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding. _B_  So uhh, how's the palace?  Ok, that's me. _B_  Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.  Yeah, thatd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.  I dont know.  I cant tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.  All right look, if youre not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!  Well, that is what happened, and I dont even see you denying this!  OhI don't know.  It was my racquet.  Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that?  I kinda have a dream! I dont want to talk about it.  Glass, sand, whatever.   Wait a minute, I cant give this to her.  Oh right, your allergies.  All her, she hates you.  _B_  Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?  If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?   That was her.  Shh!  Nice to see you again.  Airline  Were on a semi-first name basis. Mr.  You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!  Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?  Joey said that youre in here with another man!  You do? That's fantastic!  Of course it was!  I know. He has your eyes.   I know. He has your eyes.   Hey.  Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!  So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down. Rachel and  Thanks  Youre our age!  How little?!  I have to; hes my best friend, and youre seeing him.  Tonight, on a very special Blossom. Commercial Break _B_  She was a welder.  Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.  Well, you do want all that stuff, right?   So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?  Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!  Sounds great.  We dont have to come up with this now.  No! No! No! Noone can beat me.   What'?  Well Ive been playing it for like eight hours, itll loosen up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, theyre dirty words.  So how's Mindy?  And lots of kissing your neck. _B_  Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.  Yeah, wow.  Mike didn't tell you? You have to choose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.  That is a bad interview.  I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.   Oh, no-no-no-no-no....  I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.  Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them.  Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.   Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.   Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news.  Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.  Excuse me?  All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?  What?  Yeah, well, dont expect that to happen anytime soon! Commercial Break _B_  Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef. Fat  If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.  Oh my God!   You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool!  I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing.   Anyway we're talking about your dream.  I love you.  Your dream?   Really?!  See? Now, thats why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking. _B_  Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.  As crazy as soccer?   Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.  I think its the dying cat parade.  I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?  Yes, of course.  Airline  Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I dont know if he has what it takes. Mr.  Okay.  And here we go  Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack.  This game is kinda fun.  Ahh, merry Christmas; I miss you guys!  I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.  RAT BASTARD!  ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.  Wait-wait-wait-wait!  Well this one's for you.  Well, there you go.   Wellll?  Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!  What check thing?  Look, this isnt funny! You get back here right now!   Oh-no-no-no! Dont! Dont! See-see, youre getting me confused, Im starting to urn.  She has a real name.  That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.  Screw the Knicks!  Your work makes me sad.  Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!  Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you   What-what Richard thing?  Hey, yknow what? Why dont we think about changes we can make in the living room?  I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!  Because its awesome.  Whats he doing?   I'm sorry man.  Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.  Okay.  Okay.  Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.  Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie.  This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.  Don't play with his things.  Then I got all needy and clingy.  Bye-bye.   I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!  For three years?  All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down.  What?  Its the theme from Good Will Humping.  Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight. _B_  More coffee over here, please! Commercial Break _B_   So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?  Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!  I am proud of all my friends today.  You didnt get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?   You mean you didnt get it from this?  And I don't wanna say this, I don't want you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go.  Oh my god!! _B_   Oh my God!  Oh thats all right, I have it memorized. Its 1A. Airline  But this is eleven. Its almost twice as hard up here. Mr.  Im in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think theres something wrong.  I dont think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other. _B_  Hell is filled with people like you.  Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy.  What?  OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO!  No!  Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink. Girl No. 2 So what are you guys out doing today?  No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, _B_ it's about you and me and the fact that we're _B_ best buds.  You got a Cheeto on your face man._B_ _B_  Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'!  Don't worry, those are the right letters.  Mar-haaaan. _B_  What do we do? What do we do?   My lighters in there!  Commercial Break _B_   Pete Becker. Pete   Is this him?  Could I borrow it? _B_  Why not?!  I-I think we have too.  Althea?! What are you doing?!  Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.  I didnt mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.   Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluidOp! Op!   Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!  What Richard thing?  Ready!  Yeah, I mean were gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.    All right.  I thought about it and maybe youre right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.  It happened in London.  What are you doing?  Well yknow, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge.   Yeah! I... I... I liked it!  But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!  Not for me it doesn’t.  Agency  No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.  What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it supposably?  Uh, Julie.  Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.  Buddy?  She said she'd call me. Rachel and  Ah, I dont know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.  What, what, what?!  Damn!  The tailpipes not hot enough to light this!  You dont think I get up when you get up?  All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?  What does she do?  What are you guys doing out here?  Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.  Hi, Im Chandler. Your live-in boy  Those are my gifts, I got them for you.  Okay. Okay.  Yes honey, I made it myself.  I cant do it. I cant do it.  Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!!  _B_  Well, maybe we can fix it yknow? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!  Yeah! You?  Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.  Yknow that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "Youre half Scottish right?"  Apology accepted. Excuse us.  Airline  I think its best sir. Mr.  Im in the bathtub.  Alright, well, Ill check the guest bedroom. _B_  It is. Did I... not tell you about her?  Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not.  I got nothing. _B_  How do you feel?  How do you feel?  People do stupid things when they're upset.   You done?  That's what they'll call us. _B_  I want you to say that you like her!  Well, my apartment isnt there anymore, because I drank it.  Like an eclipse.  _B_  Whos he huggin?  What?!  Bye.  Are you still out there?  Oh, you must stop shooping.  You're shooting with Althea?!  With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.  And the Knicks rule all.  Ooooohh!  Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!   Yes, yes eight.   Is that a problem?  I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.  Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?  Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.    What happened? Im just eating candy.  The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.  Okay. I cant believe tomorrows the big day.  It is when you put it together with that one.  What problem did you tell him you had?  Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?    What!? Of course I did!  Uh, Rach?  OK, is there a mute button on this woman?  How do you know that? How?  Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.  There was no fish when she dropped it off.  That, that's what's stupid.  Oh God.  You tell me! Maybe, its because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!  You really think that is what he meant?  Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.  Yes, here it comes! Im stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I dont think so mister!  Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times hes wrong.  Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?  Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?  Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.   Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.   I'm not mad.  So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?  Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish.   I know, lets rest and drink lots of fluids.   I messed up. Okay? Im sorry, I really messed up.   Youve reached Monica and Chandlers, if youre listening to this message, were probably screening.  Yeah we are. The Museum  Mr. D, hows it going, sir? Mr.   Yeah?  I hope youre not thinking about cleaning the living room. _B_  See?  Here we go.  Mr.  Yes!! _B_ Commercial Break _B_  Hi dad.  What size shoes do you wear?  Yknow what you should do, just toss em in the shedder and claim you never got em. Mr.  I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The waters tepid. The salt didnt dissolve and is now lodged places. And the scents I used dont compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomileOh!  Mento?  ...And boogie!  I send them home.  I - I don't think I can.  Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with kids though. _B_  Actually, we already found a house we love.  Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.  Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.  You had to ask.  Thanks for trying.  Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!   Does this mean were gonna have to start paying for coffee?  Commercial Break _B_  This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!  Nice shooting!   Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...    Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!  Well, I did not know that. Commercial Break _B_  No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.  Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?  Oh, thats cool. Then Ill just bring them both over.  Hey!  Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Yknow? And it turns out I was wrong. And now its lodged in my throat.    Those are book ends! That's a great gift!  Phoebe Buffay in  Okay, come here!

That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon? _B_ _B_  This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.  All right!  Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.  And you dont think taking care of our chick is work?  Oh, no-  Oh-no, hes right. Commercial Break _B_   Rachel, could I see you for a moment?   No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.   No. No. Were not gonna do that, yknow why? Because its not an even trade.  Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.  It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable. Ross and  Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal.   That was so unlikely. Well, lets get married! I guess.  That would be impossible to resist if you werent all drippy here.   Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybodys allowed one mistake, right? _B_   This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!  Yes, the groomNo! Not the groom!! Commercial Break _B_  And? Mr.  Why is your family Ross?!  Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?

Because of Emma.   Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you.   You know it?  Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time. _B_  Oh, yeah?  Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare.   Hey!  I spelled out boobies.  There you go!!  Yes!  Okay, heres the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.  Well, like father, like son.  Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.    Hello children!  Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?  Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! Ill get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!  Thats great, but shouldnt you be on the toilet right now?  Now, its not wrapped because I just, just finished it.  Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.  You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!  Have you talked to him lately?

You notice that ever since we got this chick, weve been fighting a lot more than we used too?  Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.   Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.    Thanks!  Damn Rollos!  Emotional Knapsack?  By me?  What's going on?  Thats right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!  What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!  Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?  Yeah, I dont you should say that even when youre healthy.  I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.  So what does this mean? Mr.   Phil.  If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang. _B_   Those arent eleven and a half.  Hi.   Good game!  Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!  I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching?  Well, we know I'm gonna watch it.

Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair?  I think you played the Gunther card too soon. _B_  Oh, dont thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.    What is with him?  I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!  Really?! I-I thought you werent looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.  Okay.   Are you serious?  In the game room!  Whats wrong with you?  But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.  Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. _B_   Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?

These are the faces of two people in the know!  _B_  You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.  You can tell us.  Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained.  Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.  Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?  Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.  So, you don't think I'm terminal?  No! In his office! How many kisses were there?  Ah, I fooled around with Joeys sister.  Well, thats not the worst part.  Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and theres nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.  Ill take her back tomorrow.  Hey.  Right on! Oh! Uh, but, dont take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.

I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague.  Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.  Word!  Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?  _B_ I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right? _B_  It's the Miracle Wax.  Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.  It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.  Hey.  Ummmmmmmm, no.  Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.   Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging bicepsShe knows! Commercial Break _B_  All right! Thats fine! Thats fine! I wont bring over the chairs! I wont bring anything over!

Can you figure out what Im doing?   Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please dont hate me.  Hey!  Yeah, yeah right over there.

Yeah!  I know.   Monica?   Go change!  She doesnt want her parents to know shes drunk.  Hey!  Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?  Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.  We can talk about that.   See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.  Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.  Your last roommate's kidney?  It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday. MR.  Oh, just this!

What?!  Why do they put so much steam in there?!  I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!  Uh Joe, when its one oclock in the morning and you dont come by? Thats okay!  Thanks.  I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.  Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?  Well, she... she didn't win...  You're kidding.  Sure.  You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?  He's open!  Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.  Whats going on?  Whoa-ho, whoa!

What are you guys doing?   Its the semi-finals of her botchy ball tournament.  He didnt say anything about that to me.  Chandler Bing.  The whole thing! Can we go?  Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head...  Can it?  Im sorry. I told you that I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I didnt didnt know didnt think youd understand.  To Ross! All  Ross!   Interesting!  Can I see you for a second?   Interesting!  Can I see you for a second?   Oh my God!  OK. _B_ Brake left, gas right?  Where is she, Where is she?  Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?  I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'  Ladies, ladies, lets just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monicas bra.  Im coming already!!  Inever borrowed your Walkman.  Thats right! Where are the guys? Im ready to get drunk and see some strippers.  No-no-no-no!  I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!  Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.   Well, what is it?  C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."  Cups.  But the Kit-Kats are all right?!  Not really.  Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that were gonna get married.  Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?  Hey.  Okay.  Our minister  Really? Right across the street?  So shes a  No!  Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler!  I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone.  Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great.  Okay.   She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back.  She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...   Hey.  Yeah!  Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably...  Y'know, you'd think I would've.  What do we do?  What do we do?  OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.  Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!  Commercial Break _B_  OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut.  Well then maybe you should take it.  Uh, if you say so sir.  Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.  Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!  Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didnt I wouldnt have a shot?  You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!  Ill give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.  Youre a genius!  Hang on buddy!   Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?  All right, but you cant use that again for a whole year. Im in.  Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.  Oh man!  Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.   Hey-hey!  No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now.  Phone's done ehh.  What?! Why did you do that?  Look, Im not saying that you should magically forgive me! But youre not perfect! Youve made some errors in judgment too!  Damn those robots, theyre supposed to be our faithful servants!  No. How are ya Paul?    I know, but just let me say it.  What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.   Okay, will you just go help her change please!  Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?  Well now-now youre just talking crazy.  He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.  Well you should meet my uncle, Bada.  Ill let myself out. _B_  I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!  She's right! If I were a guy and...  Did I just say if I were a guy..?   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!  Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.  So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?  'Scuse me.  _B_ Where's my seat belt?   Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.  You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great!  Ahhh!   They got a breakfast buffet.   I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!  Hi!  Ill teach ya! Come on, come on, its really easy and really, really fun.  Oh thats too bad.  I see. Yknow umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.  Not that big a deal? There there was touching of things.  Oh its always nicer to hear than, "Aw crap! You again!"  Yeah!  No! No! No! Dont fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee.  And I probably wont spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.  Whend you meet her?  A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?  Well this one's for you.  'S'why I'm dancing... _B_  Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?  Ye....   Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.  Honey, there's really nothing to worry about.   Twins! Twins!!   Twins! Twins!!  Janice, you're  Fine with me.  Well, I'm going to kill you.  C'mon, we're roommates!  My eyes!! My eyes!!  He started mine first!  Math!! Youre giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, well see who gets her. _B_  Me! On my computer.   You see you cant tell which one is which either, dwha!!  Your liking it, huh?  Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.  Okay.  Now, theres two reasons.  I sure did.  Unfortunately that is correct. The  Monica.  _B_  Okay, so he's out of here.  That's patio furniture!  I am now!  Hey Mon, how's it going?  How could it not matter?!   What happened?!!  No, did he hug you?!  What?! Im Chandler!  Oh, thats Richard!  Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you fell in love with! _B_  Maybe, isnt she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?  Im full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, Ill regret it.  Because uh we-we we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.  But what did he mean by rules?  Is it made of cheese?  I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.  I personally could have a gallon of Alan. _B_  Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.  You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?  Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls.   Ooh, not so tight...  I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.  Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!  _B_  Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.   _B_ Hey!  _B_ All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people. _B_ _B_  Could you get us a couple of beers? _B_ DR.  No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them.  Hello sweet pants!  The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.  Yes, yes, we had the sex.  Ooh, let me talk to him!  Ah sure. What's in 'em?  Hi!  Okay, here you go.  I have two queens, what do you have?  So is your apron. Youre wearing it like a cape.  Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!  Oh, its okay. I dont  Well, I have some.  Hey.  Excellent! Yknow Ross met somebody too!  What?  No, I can't. No-no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry,  it's about you and me and the fact that we're  best buds.  Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?  I feel so bad. Is there, is there anything I can do to make it up to you?  I'm serious!  Hey!  Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?  Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?  Is it  Nice work my friend.  Why?  Oh my God!   Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.  Veronica. Look, its got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.  And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.   Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.  Well, I just thought itd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.  Okay, fine, $300.  I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.   What about the birds?  Okay, bye!   Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.  What about all that friends forever stuff?  What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!  Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.  I dont want him to tell this story for years.  Okay.  Yknow what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?  Because he was looking at her differently.  Dont go! Im sorry. Im so sorry!  Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!  Or, call an ambulance. _B_  Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing  Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.  Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!  Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.  No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.  Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.  Okay, now lets decide who has the nicest ass.  About what?  No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?  It was fine, yknow? But she didnt agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, Im all right with it."  Well, can I just  Ahh yes, the messers become the messies! _B_  Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.  Yes I did, and I think you should do it.   Hey!  Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!   Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.  Commercial Break _B_  Hey-hey, hey!  I dont know why I did that!  Well, close to   Oh yeah?  Yeah, thats her. The  You cant wear that!

I promised that Id be with Monica.  Merry Christmas.  Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.  Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.  Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.  I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't. _B_  Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody.  Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody.  Congratulations.  Daaahhhh!  Something else I might have said?  Look, when Ive been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and Im sorry.  No, actually Lauries a boy.  Stop what?!  Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? Hes not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys thats like a third or fourth date kinda thing.  Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.   All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, its over.  Okay!  Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!  You pick one.  No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.  Thats funny, I saw no phlegm. Commercial Break _B_  Her ankle is what youre watching?  Wow!  You are way to young to have seen that!  So--You got in voluntarily?!  Yeah?  Hi! Howd it go?  Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?   Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch. _B_  My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!  What are you doin?  Ok.   WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!   No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.  Morning.  You mean there's more than one of us.  Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..   Ill make something up! Im good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!  Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?  Shes shhing me! Its my phone and shes shhing me!  Okay.    Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?   He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.  Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?    Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?  Oh yeah! Okay, lets play again.  What do you got?  Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!  Did you not understand the story?  What are you doing tonight?   Should we call the spitter? Commercial Break _B_  SoIf you wear that youll make mine less special.  What do we do?  Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?  Football? Just football?  Merry Christmas, you guys!  No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.  Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?  I think we've found our sperm!  You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?  What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?  What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?  You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?  Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching.  No!! You cant!!  I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person.  No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!  Well, yknow Im 29. I mean who needs a savings account.  Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, yknow, I know where everything goes, its always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebodys killing her in there!"  I majored in lightning rounds. All right, were gonna destroy you.  Theres a Phoebe on my sandwich!   What?  Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!  Y'know I rued the day once didn't get a whole lot else done.  What?  It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon!  She's-she's gonna kill me.  Then why-why is she going to a play?!  Shes just doing her job!  You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.  BEND OVER?!!! _B_  Im a little busy here Paul.  Yes, you can pass for 19.  Yknow what would work?   Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Rosss situation?  Marcel?  Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could .   Look, I can't do this. I can't make luv to you while we'refighting this way.  No...if crazy plate lady..._B_ If Monica dies...then...I would get Emma...right?  _B_ What?  We are NOT signing those papers.  Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!   And yet I never run into Beyonce!  Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.  That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.  Oh it's uh, over there on the table.  No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?   Hey.  At least let me smoke it to the good part. _B_   Theyll never understand!  Oh-ho-ho, I dont think so!   Im sorry.  If you ask me, I'd move in with him.  Well, you're gonna.  Youre kidding right?  The reason we havent told them were together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?  Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.  Hey! Whats up?  Dude! Dude!   Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!  Please, dont take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!  Sure, whats up?  You dont say anything.  Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?  It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a beer...  What the...  What are you doing?  Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.  Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?  Where are Bill and Colleen?  Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.  And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.  Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!  Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!   Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus.  Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid character.  Isn't Ben in this?  Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?  Uuuh. _B_  You-you-you dont wanna give into the fear.  You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection.  'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself. _B_  I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!!  You are surprisingly strong!  Well, this is much better. _B_ The  Oh, I dont know.  Look, you dont have to draw an actual wowhoa! Shes hot!  Well, Im so confused as to what weve been doing so far  Okay.  Good one.  We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!   Yes, he is!  Not like that, I won't!  Kip would have liked the birds!  _B_  Well, why dont you tell her to stop being silly!   We should start with the big stuff. Yknow? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch.  I got it.   Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? Im going to go over to Joeys.  I think its great that you work here. Youre going to make a lot of money, and heres your first  Yeah!   ....with'  Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out.  Oh hey! There you go.  Okay.

Stop making candy!  Yeah, were gonna need to see that tape.   Oh! Hi!  Marcel?  That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, I'm notgonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to beconceived?  Actually what?  Really? Are you going to be okay?   The wife says "Hi!".  It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.  That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.  No, Eddie likes to keep it over there.  Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.  Oh, so youre going with the teacher, huh?  Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?  Well thats a full cup!   I always thought having a heart attack was natures way of telling you to die!  But youre not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but youre not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.  ...And what did you bring?  Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 900.  So this is nice! I wish I didnt have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to.  Oh uh, by the way, whats the name of the girl youre dating? Joey and  Look, its my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.  Im not going to let you say anything.  People who’ve never ever been to Paris.  I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.   Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!  We have to leave!!   You can't make this stuff up! _B_   Don't, don't!    Okay. Shhh...    Okay. Shhh...   Together.  Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.  Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.  You mean a three pointer?  Look man!   We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didnt think we could make it.   Thank you, Joey.  You mean with Casey.   There are seven?!  Steps!  Slut!  You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!  I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!   If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon? Grandma  Hey Gar!  Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?  Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.  Hey, will you grab me a cruller?  Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!  What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.  Yes, but I feel like Ive really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think were two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.  Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!  Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts.  Chan and Jan Forever.  You have done enough!  Okay!   Hi.  Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!  Well, youre not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding? Rachel and   All right, Im off to see your dad.  Huh.  You mean they like you.  For my last birthday you gave me a hug!  Okay, read the card! Read the card!  Joeys gonna be thrilled! He was hoping youd come by as a slutty nurse.  Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...   The sunll come out tomorrow! Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow  therell be sun.  Mean it?  What'!  Youre gonna put sweats on and clean, arent ya?  Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen.  You have gotta stop!  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, ooh.  Hey! Well, Ive been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you thats mean!  Run, Joey! Run for your life!   Hey.  Really?!  Say 200?  Ow!  Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?  Hey!  Janice?   It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.  Thats what Monica said.  Bye!  Commercial Break _B_  That was pretty 007. _B_  Oh, God!   We’re moving to Tulsa!   Yeah, he's better!  I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.  What?   Why!?  You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!  Why cant we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.  Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.  Listen to me!!   Or Casey.   Sounds like a really bad idea to me.   Thats one?  That was amazing!  I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?  Thats laughter.  I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and lets just get that thing pushed back in.  OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.  Nah, Nah, its okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.  Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.  Hey!   No you dontget it in black, not brown.   Janice?!  Richard! No one supposed to know about us!  See I, did it again.  Well, come on, Ive been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.  No!  Shhh!  Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?  No-no-no-no! That was the joke!  Youd think that would embarrass me, but you see Im maxed out.  Yes have you seen any? Woman No. 1 No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?  I think youll find if I come to work here, I dont micro-manage. I dont shy away from delegating.  You are incredible. Unless, I...I'm not gonna smoke again.And if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you.   This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.  _B_  Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?   She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.  Okay!  Okay!  What?  Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.  And then Joey remembered something.   Right in there! _B_  I confronted her, and she didnt deny it!  I dont live here!   Maybe, she doesnt hit him all the time. _B_  Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.   It was a car backfire!  No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."  So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!  Again?  Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to faceAnd by face I dont mean his lap. And by face, I dont mean my ass.   Look, we can’t stay in here forever.  Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes.  So, if Monica's not around, I'm not good enough to raise Emma?  Thanks. Listen, Im never gonna lie to you again.  Whoa-ho, back off, Missy!   Really? Are you sure?  Uh-huh.  _B_ Hey, big guy, game time.  All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'  Shes moving on! Okay, if its not this guy, its gonna be somebody else! And unless youre thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? Its over.  99...100! Ready or not, here I come!  All right, let's go over the concept one more time.  Could be Casey.  Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.   Oh, yknow, yknow what Pheebs?  Oh, yknow-yknow what, I was looking at it upside down.  That was amazing.  So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?  Oh my God.  I dont know.  Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!  You know when guys hang out they dont just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?   It is?  Theres no back to this couch!  Oop!   Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.  Do you have my credit card?  Yeah, Ill sit down.   No, because youre not a grandmother!   What I do do is manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.  Yeah, let's celebrate life!  ...He's in.  Your Veal Chop is $34.95!  This can not be happening!  Howdy.  Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good.  Great. It was great. Shes ah, shes great, great looking, great personality, shes greatness.   Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?! Commercial Break _B_  Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.  Yeah. I really do.  Hey.  And I am not blah, I am a hoot!  Well, its like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.  Joey's Look-A- Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?    Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor?  Yeah, I miss you too.  Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know?  Well, that's very generous  er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about....  And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier?  Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection!  No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy!  I'll see you on Monday!  _B_  No, I realize that honey, but Im not gonna spend all of the money on one party.  Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.  Im not crazy about babies. Im crazy about us.  This is okay. We’re all adults here; there’s nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let’s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door.   The Sooner State, whatever that is.  And I want you to know that no-one thinks that you are stupid.  I don't know  Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.  This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.  What, like a number?  He paints quite a picture doesn't he? _B_  Okay.  Hey!  Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.  Consider Casey.  Im not Jewish, so  Fine, lets do it.  No, you're the best.  Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.   Yeah, I do.  Oh no, you see, actually it is.  Yeah I know, but I figured a shot yknow? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldnt think I was yknow, all dead inside.  Well?  Thank God!    Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!  You see, I dont say _B_  That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.  Hardest thing Ive ever done in my life.  What...what is wrong with me? Am I, am I incompetent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!  But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?   But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?  The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.  Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.  So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh? Commercial Break _B_  That's me.  See ya. _B_  Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.  Joey told you about the leg, huh?  Oh-no, yknow with Gandolf wed be out all night!  That-thats bad?  Uh, Ross?  Love your condoms my man.  Get off! _B_  But you found the keys to his clothes?  No thanks, Josephine. _B_  No, you shNo you said you made that up!!  Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...  Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.  Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, its going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! Were not even sure why were having it.  Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.  Sure, why dont you set it up. Ill just be over here, browsing through the personals.  Look, weve always talked about having babies someday. Im not saying it has to be right now, but Im starting to think that we can handle it. Were good. Were really good.  Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning! Surrey With A Fringe On Top.  Games tomorrow night, Joe. _B_ _B_ _B_ Rachel,   No,... no...  NO!  Look, I'm, I'm married!  So you know this leaves us with...   She? It's a girl?   She? It's a girl?  Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?  You want some help.  Hi! Bye!   I know.  _B_  Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.  Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy."  Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?  That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place! _B_  Bad dream?  Yknow you, really didnt have to take me to the airport.  Oh my God.  No, you're the best.  Who jumps at loud noises!  Look, Im just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.  Oh Joeys got a really bad hernia, but thats nothing a little laser eye surgery wont fix!  Hey Ross, I was wondering if Oh my God!! Where are all the men'? _B_  Oh, no I don't.  Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.  Look at this!   Oh, I cant go.  Yes.  Matire' Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?   Whoa! Shes purty!  Oh!   I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn’t for fun.  See? Intuitive!  I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!  I know..  That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?  At least as long as I have the pants.    What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.  Actually, uh, we're both the father.  _B_ Chandler and  Oh, I couldn't be happier.  Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldnt have, but it did. I mean I like her, I dont want to stop seeing her, but every so often its like Hey, y'know what, wheres your leg? I mean Im the smallest person in the world arent I? Im the smallest person in the world.  The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!  Well you might if it were anything like 7!  Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julies  Okay, Im going to go stand over there.   Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?   Well I mean, let me get the door first.  Oh, hi! No one.   Well you did pull his hair.  Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?  Eh, theyre both good. I generally just go with, Monicas drunk again.   Cupping.  Yes, I am!  There has got to be a way!  Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.  90 seconds.  Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.  But nothing has to happen until your ready.  No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus.  I’ll get out of it.  I'm *happily* married.  There you go! Someone came!  How do you feel about that?  Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!  When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?   Well, now we have one of each!  And that's enough! _B_   Well, now we have one of each!  And that's enough! _B_  Its gotta be the first one.  Im sorry, Im sorry, it just seems that Robert isnt as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.  And thats the only colour that comes in.  Off?!!   Joey kept screaming at me, Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!! Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.  Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.  She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.  Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebes song about?  Well, were really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.  You remember Janice.  I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?  Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.   Not once did we do that.  I did, but...  No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, were up at the altar and Im like this.   Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...  Nancy Thompsons getting fired!   Phoebe knows about us!   Marry her. _B_  Really?   Why? Why-why-would you—Wh-why…  Look, I just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever we want. Mr.  What did I just say?   oh, honey..  Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.   All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?  Please tell me you know which one is our baby.  She's one of us now. _B_  There's another carton right over there.  Before!!   Actually hes the smallest person in the world.  Yes! See you and I have always been like _B_  Pregnant Woman Slays Four?  Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first  All right, bye-bye now!  Im not getting into this again!  That is true.  Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.  Who the hell is Carl?!  I can see it now, "Look dad, its the Sphinx!"   Oh, thats uh, thats pretty nice but Im gonna go with the one I picked first.  I still dont get it, we didnt do anything wrong.  Yeah.  Oh no wait, Im not an nine-year-old girl.  Marcel?! _B_  You know, it haunts me? Up til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!  Im sorry, did you say cheese?  What?! Its not right! Were not ready to have a kid now!!   What is wrong with Emma?  Look, I may not know alot about babies, but you really think I'm not capable?  Right. So, I'm sorry...  Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.  I think.... I think I can see your scalp.  Which technically now you should give back!  And that's how you bought it?  God, I love these fingers...  Yep, Im in a tree. _B_  Yeah, well I dont think you can make that statement, unless youve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.  You-you do?  Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?  Okay. Then I guess its just, wait here then.   Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen. Ticket Counter  What?  Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look.   Hey.   Oh my God!   Hey!  Okay.   Call me! _B_  Yeah?   Hey.   OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.  I cant help it!  Yknow, that party wasnt bad.  Okay. _B_ The Cooking  Uhh. You are welcome.   Please, come in.  Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...  Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to.  Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and  "Oh My God"!  You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.  Ok.  Alright, so what's it about?   Hello, Janice.  It came up.  So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.  Do either of you have the keys?  Hi!  Yeah, we are so sorry.  Why?! What happened?!  Well, I told you not to walk. Here.  There. Okay.   That's not specific to girls.  Yknow sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, arent they?  I cant believe I did this! What an idiot!  What?  Hey!   Uh, excuse me? Could you take a picture of us? Woman At The  I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!  I cant believe there is a naked hooker in there!  Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.  I can do that.  Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I dont believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I wont stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.  Im kidding. This is going to be fun.  Umm ma’am, do you have a minute?  I kind of have some bad news. I don’t think I can move to Tulsa. Ms.  Ok, so if we both had Emma, and I die _B_ she'd have to give her up.  Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this   Yeah.  I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. "Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real."  Oh, so that's what this is for.  Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.  No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.  Yeah.  So, you still dont think Im boyfriend material?  You got me.  So yknow, uh, whens he getting back?  Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket. Ticket Counter  Thats a low one!   You knew about this?   You're naked in this picture!  Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.   So, what do you think?  Okay, well I wont uh, worry about this anymore then.  I couldnt do it.  This is great!  Helen, could you come in here for a moment?   I had to okay?! Were getting married! Married couples cant keep secrets from one another!  Borrow money from me?  Well, you still havent taken down the Christmas lights.  I dont see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?  What?  Emma was doing it!  Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.  Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?  So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.  If you win, we give up the birds.   Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door.  Oh, that does it too.  _B_ r  All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker. _B_  Yeah?  Well I like both eggs equally.   Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?  Oh, thats mature.  Where?  Air hole! Air hole!!   Not even on page 7?  No!  Oh yeah? Well, howd she take it?  Yeah.   Do you think hell ever forgive me?  Thank you Helen, that'll be all.   They put you in jail?  Well maybe it was all of your questions.  Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it.  Maam, are you also a stripper?  So, hows the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?  Okay. Now all weve got to do is get rid of this chair.   No. But Im sure  tomatoes does.  Treasure of the Sierra Madre!  Were trying to get pregnant.  Yknow Im not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So, when do you want to start trying?  It’s a funny story, actually.  I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said I’d move to Tulsa, I didn’t really know what I was saying. Ms.  We are gonna be great parents.   By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.  Yeah.  Your cappucino sir.  Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go..   What?  I saw you checking me out during the game last night.  Yeah. Right.  Yknow, I knew something like this was going to happen.   What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with? Ticket Counter  I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!  Oh my God!  Ross?  Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.  I know!   Okay!  Ahh, I think it just moved. Its really poking me.  And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.  Aww, I love you so  Hey, relax I just need more time. Were going to dinner tonight.  Last time I do that, I promise. _B_  Du-ude!  Why is there jelly on your shoe?  Im just trying to find the right moment, you know?  Uhh Yeah sure.  Click! Woman At The  What honey, its like fifteen blocks to the subway. Lets go.  You can always sell your baby.  But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple ofcigarettes--no big deal.  So...so let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma, then my wife dies, then Emma the one-tiny-ray-of-hope left in my life, gets taken away from me?  Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...  At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps   And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.   You're Jewish.  But if we win, we get your apartment.  Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.  Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.  Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs? _B_   No. Not anymore.  I got something for her.  It's a book!  Prague?   All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.  What about that circled one?  No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.  And youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry?  Yknow what? I-I kinda have.  Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!  Ahh yes, the messers become the messees! _B_  Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!   The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!   Hi!  Thats a good idea.  Oh, I know!  You dont?  Madre Sierra the of Treasure!  Period math?  But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ain’t that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright . See, here’s the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won’t go. See, me, I love Tulsa! Tulsa is heaven! Tulsa is Italy—Please don’t make me go there! Ms.  I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!  Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?  Mine was a humdinger  Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish!  The Blowfish!  Work on your music? _B_  Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.  Don't go.  All right.  Yeah, well, lucky for you.  Okay. _B_  And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again? Joey and  Yes you can. Youre thinking about time, you cant go back in time.  No. All right, yknow what, shes  gonna think that Im handing you a credit card, but what Im really gonna do is hand you a library card. Ticket Counter  Whats the second part of your plan?  Why are you screaming and hugging?  You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!  Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.  Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.  What?!   See you later.   That is funny, maybe for my birthday shell murder someone.  Whats going on?  Leave it.  Some guy, Tom Gordon.  Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!  Closing credits_B_  What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?  Alright.  Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.   OH MY GOD!!!  No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?  But if we win, we get your apartment.   I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?  Uh, Dana Keystone from college.  Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.  Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"  Hey.    Was that another question?  How come?  Okay.  So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?  So you you dont want to live with Don in a cheese house?  Id like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut please.  Yeah.  No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol?  Wh-why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping!  That’s a picture of your daughter, isn’t it, well she’s lovely. I like a girl with a strong jaw. I’ll call you from Tulsa.  _B_  Oh, did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?  You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms...   Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?  Hey, Zack!  What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears. _B_  He really is a chameleon.  Neat.

Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.  Yes, it is.  Sorry! Mrs.  Hey, is Rachel here?  Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?! _B_  So you didnt mean any of that?!  You didnt see how mad he was, yknow?   Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!   The Museum  Hey!  You know, once youre inside, you dont have to knock any more.  What?  Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!  That’s funny, this conversation’s how I got the bullet hole in my head. Mr.  You tricked me to get me into bed?  Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby? Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle. _B_  Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.  Who are those people?  Are you all right?!  No, it came out to an even twenty.   No you cant.   American Express? _B_  Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.  So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?  Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me food." Two is, "Im with a girl, bring us food." Three is, "Im lost and I cant find food."  No, that was Dana Caplin. The  It was the ring! _B_  Monicas gotta have the phone in the right place and  Oh yeah. Ill take, Ill take your picture.  Man At The  To see her pants?  Oh actually, Id rather you Yeah, go ahead. Were gonna have to burn that room down anyway. _B_  Well, its not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? Yknow? Youre doing nothing wrong.  Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby.  Richard? If-if youre in there, could you pass me my credit card? _B_  Poor Ross.   I love you.  Six!  Right here?  Y'know but they're right. I'm not a strong father-figure and I never will be.  But we don't do that.  Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.  Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.  Umm, yeah.  Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.  Whats it about?  Hey, Im going for sushi does anybody want..  Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.  She doesnt know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I cant even return them, because she choked on the reciept!  Nothing, nothing.  Hey, look, youre in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, shes gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.  Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?  Im sure youre right, but why?  Which I may say, right now, is out of control.   Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.  Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever  In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.   Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!   Oh thats great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please?  There we go.  So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right.  Its oddly unsettling.  Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!  Im so sorry.  I feel so used. _B_  Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star!  Hey, this is so unfair!  Where have you been?  Dangerous Liaisons.  Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.  All right, call it in the air.  Ok.  Here in Chelsea.   What happened?!!  You dont want to be guys, youd be all hairy and wouldnt live as long.   I can't believe you did this.    Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!  See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!  I think thats gum.  Believe me, Ive been saying that for years. Oh my God!  Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here! _B_  Are you sure? Did you see the stain?  Yknow what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers .  No? Really? They taste so good. _B_  It hurts me. It physically hurts me. _B_ The   Hungry monkey.  Wait a minute, its perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and were in a building thats full of beds!  Ring dammit, ring!  Yeah, but it's not who I am. Everything they said is exactly why I was worried about having a kid. And it's true! And, look, everybody knows it.  How drunk are you?  Really?  Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?  Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?  What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!  Well, it sounds kinda stupid...  Whos she?  Okay.  Its a racecar.  I dont know, y'know. What, what, would you do?  It still wouldnt be clean.  All I want is my freedom.  No. Is there anyway, anyway you think hell understand this?  Well, those were seals, man. _B_  Oh, man. Im sorry, Im so-so sorry.  There we go!   I don't like your massages.  No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.  Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?  No! Her boyfriend Richard!  You win.  Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?  Hey!    How are you feeling?  Hop on.  Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch  What?!  So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?    Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!!   Tyrannosaurus!   Mazel tov! _B_ Dr.  If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, yknow. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!  Heads it is.  No?  A woman's  Well, thats the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually Ill be in Cuba.   Hey! Which ones my turkey burger?  Oh, yeah, I dont know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.   What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!  Okay.   Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.  Sorry.   Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.  Okay, listen this really hurts. Lets go.  Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!   This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!   Yeah. O-okay.  Thats Mr. Garibaldi playing the piano.  God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?  Oh yeah, well, can you picture me saying, "Go to your room! You're grounded!"   That's the perfect amount!  My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.    They're out there!  I got the time to get to know Julie.  Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?  We're not gonna talk about girth are we?  Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.  I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?  Wow! Look at them run.  Okay, well it this bed isnt new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?  Come on, tell me.  Freedom!  I know! I know!  I'm still mad at you for not telling me.  Let's go quicker.  Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?  Okay, but now see you're crying!  You dove in front of Ross! Ross!  All right, let me in.   When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!   What? What?  It doesnt matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?  Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird turtle-man?  Honey, I know youre in pain right now, but Im a little turned on. _B_  You dont owe me anything, I dont want you money  Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall. _B_  What?!  Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches.  Ok!   Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.   Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.  We have to assign heads to something.  Alright, hang on a second there Custer.   Chelsea.  What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?  SoYou got in voluntarily?!  Oh, dont say that! Dont say that. Thats not true. Is it?  Yeah baby!  And you're okay with that?  Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"  Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!   Im right here!   Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and dont talk to anyone.  Well, I feel like a snack!  Hes coming into the audience. Hes coming into the audience.  Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!  Oh dear God!  Well, lets just say its ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.  Tell it to the Time Turtle!  You said that to me last week.  Wrong number?   Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says "Rangers" on it. They went to the game!  Fancy.   New York is awesome!  Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.  Yeah, okay.  Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?  Yeah, Ill go get one.  What?  What are you, what are you talking about?  Freedom! I want my freedom! Why wont you here me?!  Sophie, help me! Help me!!   Well, yknow, youre-youre gonna meet somebody! Youre a great catch! Yknow when I was telling all those guys about you, I didnt have to lie once.   What?  Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!  I do not hate Ross!  What?  Thanks.   Sorry, my my thing was in there with me. _B_  Not 700 exactly?  Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!  So do you think uh, Joeys more charming than me?   Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.  What?  Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!  Howdy doody.  Oh thats all right sir, and thats just one girl.  I dont know, five hundred dollars?   I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!  This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.  What?  Work people? Nobody told me.  You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya? End Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!   Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec?  Your tailor is a very bad man!  What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday? _B_  Can I be that guy? _B_   Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?  Hey, Lowell.  Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, its gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow Im conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.  BEND OVER?!!! _B_  You gotta let me slam the door!   Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.   Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.  It's true.  Oh, hey guys!  Oh no-no-no, thats notNo-no-no!  Pheebs!!  Oh no thanks. I dont like anything from my Scottish heritage.  See Joe, not that thats not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Yknow, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!  And yet you dont recognize that youre crazy.  Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!  That's great!   Ross' shirt is torn.  Fancy guest.  Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.  If you guys feel this big , maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.  And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard. _B_  I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.  Yeah! All right! You go first.  Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.  Well, hello!  Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?  Hi.  Then why didnt you tell me to do that?!!  Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?  It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.  Yes you did! You look happy and sick What picture?  Double it!   Yeah, you wish.   Now Monica, I know youre upset, but dont forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then theres going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.  Im still right here!   Its a nickname, Ill explain later.  You bet I did, Ben, put it there!   Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small!  Ho, ho, ho!  Ross is Batman!  Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!  _B_  Oh relax man, relax. Youre looking a little flushed.  Its a hand. Its a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.  Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.  Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!  I know.  You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.  Let me tell you why you need to pick me.  See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.  Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.  Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with?  Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.  Y'know, I feel like I've lost her..  Ba-! _B_  Im here to see Mary-Angela.  So how's it going there in Financial Services?  Excuse me, Doug?  Hey there sports fan!!    Coffee house?  Im gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just  _B_  Okay.   Tickets please!  Thats courtside baby!  Again true.  I'm not a dropper!  Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.  No-noReally?!  Well its just my entire family was run out of Scotland by Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.   No, not us  Us!   Heres another plan No!   Oh come on!!  Nngghhh!!!!!!!  You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!  Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?  Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?  _B_  Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.  In a bad way?  Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back. _B_  Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.  Okay.  You.  Do you have any beers? Were out of beers.  Okay, good. Commercial Break _B_  No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?  Oh, it doesnt matter.  Hey, yknow what, Ive got two tickets to tonights Rangers game, you wanna come with me?  You put your fist through the wall?  No, no, youre right, it is a ridiculous name!   Hey!  The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.  Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.  I wish I had smoked for my career  Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!   Next time?  Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.  Okay, one more time.   I KNEW IT!!!! _B_  We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .  Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.  Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!  What question?  Oh no-no-no!   This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape.  Okay, here we go.  Do you want a calculator?  Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...  Well, I have kissed over four women.  Do you wanna get under the covers?  Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection.  Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.  You think I should?  You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.   You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.    Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make "groom" for Chandler.  You told him to play the boxer gay!!  Wheres Mary-Angela?  Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....  Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.  No, I ah, I didnt do them.  How do ya do.   But you found me!  No they didnt! _B_  Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.  All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.  It's throwing and catching!  Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica thats as good as garbage?  Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup?  Oh-ohhhh!   Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh  You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!  Why?  Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?  So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.  Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.  Princess Leia in the gold bikini.  Nono, just you.  You okay?  No, wed just like to close them. Bank  Well, actually its a hockey team, so its angry Canadians with no teeth.  Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.  Yes that was mine.  Just a little bit of sugar.  Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.   Really?  When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.  There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!  Hey, I didnt make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500.  Dont get to excited because thats not gonna happen unless you getNo way!  _B_  Yeah, Im not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore. _B_  Perfect decibel.  Who?  Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because its romantic, but because I can!  You-you-you didnt know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done! _B_   Here I am.  Batman has a utility belt!  It cant happen like this. Okay? Ill meet you back at the hotel.   Why dont you go up on stage. Ill get a picture of you doing the speech.  Theres no question.  Why have I seen this thing three times?!  Here!   Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how it ends.  Okay!   Yeah?  Okay.  Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?  Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...  You totally screwed him over.  Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!   Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.   No. No. I dont think so.   He has sex, and we get hit in our heads. _B_  Really.  No, no I just ah, didnt do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly dont deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.  God!!  What am I gonna do?!  Dangerous Liaisons.  Kill me. Kill me now.    Hey!  Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!  Oh! Oh! That's so hard.    Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.  Well maybe there is one thing you can do.  Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?  Why?  I fear a jury will see it the same way!  I think we may have really done it this time.  I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide.    I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk?  "Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..." Spit it out, David!  I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk?  "Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..." Spit it out, David!  Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?  Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.  Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.  Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.  I know!  Lose the other guys.  Right.  Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.   Have you ever been with a woman?  I have no name.  Yes that would have made more sense.  Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?  Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!  Yes.  From a bullet!  That's so funny, because I think I just did!  Basically we just feel that he's...  Hes being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!  Okay, is this lamp in the same place?  Its my joke. Ross and   Here you go Joe, heres the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for.   Are you funny?  You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!  How did you know?  _B_  Wow, this is serious. Ive never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.  I think its necessary.   See Joe, we want you to tell stories but yknow, romantic stories. Nice stories.  Batman has the Batmobile!   You picked Ross?!  also I was the point person on my companys transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system. The  Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes  What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl!  It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.  But honey you don't have to.  Okay.  Thanks man.  That's great.  Cupping.  Good save! We're back on track, and I'm...  ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.   So- you can tell?  Doug!!  I wanna quit the bank! _B_  Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!  What happened? What happened?!   For an emergency just like this.  Oh, you get used to it.  Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so  I think you smell great!  _B_  Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.  Hey.  Its my joke.  I was asleep.  Oh no! No-no honey! Yknow whats sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.  Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?  Hmm.  Okay, dont say anything, you might scare it away.   Can you people not see me?!   But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.  We heard you play all the way from your apartment!  You see that?  You may wanna get some more of those too.   Kori? Kori Weston?   Why did you look at me when you said that?  Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.  No freakshow, she's fictional.  Okay.  C'mon, we're great together, why not?  Noo!! You dont have a boyfriend because....I dont, I dont know why you dont have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.  Thats-thats my nubbin.  So there is no good time to ask that question. _B_ The  Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.  It's a kitchen slash bathroom.  Absolutely!  Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.  Much sense?!  We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.  Fine with me!   No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.  Yeah?  Its Paris, who knows were here!  Ross came in fourth and cried!  Batman has Robin!  We get ESPN right?  I cannot believe you didnt pick me.  That I did. That I did. The  Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.  Is that a problem?  Yep!  Where's Emma?  Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!  I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.   You couldn't be cool.   Whoa! Don't know about that. _B_  Oh-ho-ho-ho.   So you don't think I have a, a quality?  Im a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.  Yeah, I know.  Oh!   So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?   Hey!  What?  Oh nothing, were just talking. Yknow, blah-blah-blah.  Lets have Monica decide.  Would you please get some rest!  Well, the heart wants what it wants. Ill see you later.  _B_  Oh.  Hey.  Fine, I'll give the suit back. _B_  Thats not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just dont feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.  All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if its not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!  Wait, you guys, look!  No, no that's ok. You're totally right I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But...you did hurt my feelings...so, I want you to know that if I die, you don't get Joey. _B_ _B_  Wow! You look amazing!  Thank you.  Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.  ...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'  Oh-ho, come here.  Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman Ive ever known in real life. _B_   Yes... thank you. That was... that was....  Its kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.  I have the lung capacity of a two year old.   Did she call?  Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?  We are bad people.  I paid for those tickets!  Yeah!  _B_  Oh yeah, it's so cool.  Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100.  That's pee-pee.   Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back!  Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you.  So, you're old and small. _B_  So you risked your life, for a sandwich!  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm not so worried.  What is the matter with you ?!?  Im sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.  Joe?  Actually, I dont like martinis.  Okay, give me a second!  Did you clean up in here?  Oh really?! You think youre stronger? Why dont you prove it?   Why would she do that?  Youre turning into a woman.   My duties?  All right. The  Yes, money well spent!  Count of three?  Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!  What?  It's ok, it's ok. You know what?  I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter.   So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?  Hey, big...  I'm goin' home.  Uh-oh. _B_  I dont think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in.  Draw!!     Im telling ya, Joannas got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, This was fun. Lets do it again sometime. Ill give you a call.  He is?  No, no. It-its not about the swearing, its more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.  Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.  Hey!  Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-  Oh.   Well, lets just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.   I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.  Yeah!  Oh my good God.  Ehh.  Santa? Really?  Because we hate them.  Oh youve got to be kidding me.  You need new clothes. _B_  No, the babys out! Look, look!  your ass?!?!?  Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.  Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?  Well maybe he was nervous. _B_  And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....  I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...  Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as...  Ahh, what?  Well its very unsettling. _B_   I wasnt doing anything.  Uh-oh, what did she do now?  Fancy.  All right, maybe I should call her.  Its Clint. Its Clint!   Oh yeah!  _B_  So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.  Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.  Isn't that Ross's money?  What are you talking  Youre arranging flowers!  You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!  Oh-oh.  Isnt that what happened with you and the bridesmaid?  Ooh, yum!   Oh, you're-you're going?  And the world will never know.  This is the worst bachelor party ever!  Now Ive upset you? What did I say?  Id like a Google Card.   I see. The  Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food  Two!  Okay.   Then, I don't get it.   Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and..  Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. .   Excuse me.  . That didn't make us sound gay at all!  The Hitlers will be so disappointed.  Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.   ...spender.  _B_ Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. _B_ Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.  Thats what you say at the end of a date.  Out of my league. I could get a Brian.  If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian.  Hey, Brian. End Oh, and dont get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. Its just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, its making all the other guys jealous.  Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!  Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.  Is that a real thing?  No thanks, Mom!   I'm sorry you misunderstood...   Oh no! No! No! No!   What?   Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.  And protected them from a tornado?   Oh great!  Mon, get out here!  Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.  Pheebs, were not giving you a deposit for our wedding!  Look, I thought about it too, and Im sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.   Where's Monica?  Knit, good woman, knit, knit!  _B_  Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?  We have heard you play.  I did.  But it came at a price.  And look how happy the mom is now!  They...do that?  Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood!   Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.  Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman Alison, from work, she's great. She's pretty. She's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.  Monica, it's 630 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.  I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know!  ...The second guy.  Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.  You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?  Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.  715.  Watch doesnt work.  No!  Fancy guest.  Really?!  I don't know.  Of course!  Youre turning into a women.  Okay, anything for you sir?  I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.   And thats the Chrysler Building right there. Mr.  Hm-hmm, I told you!  I cant believe that Ive only got two hours before I call in sick for work.   It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy we're gonna have all the sex.  Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.  Hi honey Im home.  Yes!  No!  Google!   Good to know. The  They do?   They loved it.  Ross, that was 16 years ago!  How's it going?  I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.   Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.  Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.  So how'd it go?  Fine.   Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?  Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.  Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.  To her face? Look its the end of the date, Im standing there, I know all shes waiting for is for me to say Ill call her and its just y'know, comes out. I cant help it, its a compulsion.  Okay.   Uhh, no-no thanks.  Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.  Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?  Its Clint! Clint!  Oh, will you give me the thing.    Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.  When did that happen to you?!  Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.  Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.  Oh, the mixed tape.    Turns out he is kinda funny. Commercial Break _B_  Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I dont care!   Yeah, Im putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then thats what were gonna do.  Why not?   Then it's okay!   Okay, you ready for the last picture?  Couldn't be more out.    In a minute? Whats gonna happen in a minute?!  Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies.  Was it just me?! _B_  You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really proposing?  Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.  Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.  God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?  I didn't know Ross and you were so close.  Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.  Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.  I'll take that.  Okay, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. Okay, in fact I kind of like the last pound. Okay, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.  Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.  You said...  Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.  _B_   Hey! Howd the interview go?  Hmmm, thats very cool.  I think somebody has a crush on somebody.  With extra pulp?  Oh my God!  Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?  Okay.  Thanks.   Okay!  Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.  Now Ive upset you? What did I say?  Okay! Okay! Okay!   Of course it is.  Wowwhoa!  Well, youre not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes  Not if I kiss you first.   But youre not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.  Were you just ten seconds later!   Youre going down.  It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldnt give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!  Nooo!!  No dont I beg of you! The  I just wan't to...  They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.  I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair.  All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.   That's what I was doing too.  Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake!   Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.  The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.  Then what?  Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?   Hi.   Ahhhhh!  _B_  I KNEW IT!!!! Closing Credits _B_  Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer.   Its-its about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.  Well y'know, what if she didnt actually sleep with the guy?  Okay.  Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.  Well, I just  Because youre the only one that can be fair.  Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cats name?  What?!  _B_  Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, yknow? Well pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.  Well, I, I should go in there.  Get ready to run.  Congratulations on your wedding.  _B_  Why me?!  Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it look like?!  Eh!  _B_ _B_  Really? He does?  Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!   Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?  I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.  Monica's grandmother.  Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.  Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.  Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?  She was not good. Not good.  Im talking about you. You big, big freak.  No!  How do you know?!  What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!  Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?  Yeah, you almost overreacted to something. Phoebe and  Too dry.  Okay! , the coffee table forward , and taped a square outline on the floor.)  Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.  Wait, we cant do this. Phoebe and  Its not all juice!  _B_  What a great apology!  And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!  Hey!!!  Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.   Because, if Santa and the Holiday Armadillo?  ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!  Do you wanna?  And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.  Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.  Yknow what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like Its a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.  This is the best game ever!!! _B_   Really?! The  So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?  But I just wa...  She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.   Oh really?  You too.  Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.  I never stopped loving you.  Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.   Yeah?  I, I know. _B_ _B_  Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because its, its, its not gonna be easy.  I cant believe she cracked your code!  We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.  What?  Yeah.  She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!  Are you all right?  Really?   Oh-oi-ho, yeah!  Oh my God! Someones killed Square Man!  Listen, Im really glad you got the part.  Was the setting of Phoebes triumph.  No! Youre the sweetest!  _B_ The   Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!  Yeah.  There I am!  Why not?  And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy. Mr.   We need the stuff. _B_  Which is why you should do it.  Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.  Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.   What? _B_  I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.  Hey.   I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.  What are you guys doing together?  ....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.  Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.  Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.  Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard youd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!  You dont have it.  Hi!  All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.   At this?!  I need to talk to you, it's urgent!  Yeah.  Monica! This is the Men's room!  Isn't it?  No!  Bye! Thank God  I dont wanna know what Monica got me. Yknow? I mean, look, Im sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.  As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that Im going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.  But then later that night  Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!  Ooh, I dont know if were there yet. _B_  Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Yknow Ive been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing.  Duties.  Duties!  Poo.  The  Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.  Oh really!?  Me too.   I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.  Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.  I didn't know you had another level.   Takin' that with you, huh?  Yes. Yes! Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.  I think you should go back with Gary. I dont wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know Youre the reason, you are the reason why their not together. and I hated that guy. And it didnt matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.  Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like,  banging his hands together!  Okay. All right.  Hey, look, what do you want from me?  What?  Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.   Thats not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.  I think I do!  Thank you, Monica.  My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!  _B_  Hm-hmm.   Oh thats so sweet! I want to show you something too!  But are you sure you can do this?  Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.   Dont try to sway her.   Im your only chance to have a baby. Okay, lets go.  Oh my God!  Richard!  Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.  That was you!  Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.  This is ridiculous.   Oh, no, no. Nina...  ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all. Mr.  Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?  You do it!  Okay, look, just do it gently.  Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.  That's ok. _B_  So in your whole life, you've only been with oneoh.  You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.  Yeah me too.  Oh, I don't know, a million?  Really.  I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?  Hey, this isnt like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!   Uh-oh. _B_  How do Monica and Phoebe know?  Yeah, all right.  Joey's a sex addict.  Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.    Okay.  No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!  No!  Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.  Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I dont know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monicas face when I give her my present, and Im sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?  Okay, so you will meet our guys?  I cant believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!  I would really love it if I could do both.   Hey!  Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big  Because I'm in love with Monica!!  What else is new?  Oh my God this doesnt count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! Theres a crazy guy out in the hall! The  Really? Okay, so...  That sounds like fun.  ADRIENNE TURNER!!   I'm not supposed to tell you.  I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?  Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.  Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.   "Big guy?"  Umm, this is nice.  Yeah, well. Its the right thing to do.  Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.   Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.  Oh, they said uh, You dont have insurance here, so stop calling us.  I am pretending.  Oh uh, when?  Gotcha!   Oh my God!! _B_  Coffee in a fight!  _B_  I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.  All right, should we just, should we just get married? Yknow? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.  Yknow those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?"  Now, is that never talking about it again?!   Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!! _B_  Oh you knew that. Good!  Well, stuff like whered we live, yknow? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Yknow, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, wed have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.  Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!  And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others. Mr.  Did you do it on our invitations?!  All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave!  What?  Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!  Bye!  Bye!  Yeah, just second.  Good-bye Mr. Heckles.  We'll try to keep it down. Ending Credits _B_  And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.  Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .  I'm fine.  Ross, dont. Ross! Monica; Ross! _B_   Go on.  Ahh, come on! Yknow whatyknow what, I think Im just gonna go home and call Kathy.  What was that?  Okay, bye!  Oh my God!!   Monica  Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!  Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!  Yes.  That's perfect! That's brilliant!    Yeah, this is so good, that Im gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert. _B_ Mrs.  Fine!   Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.  Okay now it doesnt matter which one you choose, yknow? Its completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.  Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe?   Hello?  Damnit!  Hello?  No, Joeys not here right now, but I can take a message I think.  Hes still got a chance for the part?! Oh, thats great news!  Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog.  Oh well, thats great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you!  Yes!  Okay, Mac audition at 200. Allergy actor attacked.  By dog not flowers. _B_  No, its not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monicas face when I gave it to her, yknow? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye.  Look, this is the most important thing Im gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure its perfect.  What?  Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.  What?  Well I was I wasn't exactly expecting company after  915.  Kinda. Theyre really big.  Love her! That's right, I LOVE HER!!! I love her!!  I love you, Monica.   Chandler.   Ill look forward to your call.  _B_  Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?  Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?  It's over/Joe!  Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!   You told us both we could be in the wedding?   Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says "mom" on his shovel-wielding arm! _B_   Obviously.  Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.   You still can't stand her can you?   Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay.  Okay, what do I do?  Okay, on three. One....Two....  No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?  Then dont leave me!  Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got.  See, she's fully dressed, right?  Why? What happened to him?  Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her?  No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!  Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?  Sorry!  Thanks man.  Me too!  Yknow? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, thats you and I together! Merge!   Ahh, third base.  Sure you do.  I dont know, but dont worry, dont worry, because I know how to take a picture now.  Okay, see? Look down , look down, look down   Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir.  _B_ Soothing male  Joey got meat sauce on the banister again!   So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed!    Y'know, I've had dates like this.  I dont think weve actually done this before!  Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that...  what happens to cranberry sauce?  Sure.  My god, that's a big head! It didn't look this big in the office. Maybe it's the lighting. My head must look like a golf ball at work. All right, don't get hung up on it, quick, quick, list five things you like about  I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.  Alright, we're gettin' closer.  So I got ya something. _B_  I'm not fine. Here she comes.  No, Beth doesnt die, she doesnt die. Does she Rachel?  And Milton Berle has a  No! That was a test! In a couple of hours Im gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, Im gonna get so drunk, Im gonna wanna call Janice  Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?   Oh yeah, there-there she is!  Will you marry me?

What are you guys talking about?  No. No, see when I first meet somebody its uh its mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.  Okay, worst case scenario.

Oh Im sorry, youre kicking me out of my own living room?  I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.  I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.   That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.  I'll tell you at the wedding.  Oh my God!   Bob here.  Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.  What?  We should always always break up together.  Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.  Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.   Well hello!   Oh my God!   Hey.  Now this feels like Thanksgiving. _B_  But we're not ready to tell yet!  Come on in.  Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.  Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.   Yknow I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?  So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steves doctors name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, Doctor Monkey? And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.   Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Rosss! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!  Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!  You kidding? Youre the most beautiful woman in most rooms   Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whats going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?  Sleeping with somebody  Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.  All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!  Let's go!   No, no, no.  Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.   They're never coming down now. _B_  Okay.  Okay.   Hey, he's not crying.   Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.  Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going? MR.  Okay.  Ohhh. Dont go.  Multiple, so many paper cuts.  Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.  Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!   So, I guess this is over.  What are we gonna do?  What? The  I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.  Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.  Whoa!  No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.  Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!   Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?  Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.  Oh yeah, totally!  Yknow what? I dont trust you with this cake anymore!

Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry.  Really?!  Really?!  The doctor.  Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.  Well let's .let's see what everybody thinks of that?  Sure.   Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.   They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!  Well, what if all my stuff was here?  Whats wrong?  Im not arguing with that.  Sorry! I-I-I dont know what to say.  Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.  But we dont do that.  You know, you think I would.   Actually Monica and I are engaged.  Hey!  Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.  I think she looks cute.  ... but I am wrong!  Honey, it's gonna be okay.  We could trade later.  We could trade later.  Oh God!  No. No! No! No!   Oh, well give me the phone then.  See uh, thats-thats actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.   And then the peacock bit me.  Please kiss me at midnight.   That's very funny. We done now?  Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.  About Ross!  I'm doing this because I'm sorry?  Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!   No-no-no-no-no!  Aww.  For camp!  Oh yes!  Hey!  Okay, here we go.  Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And theres another reason too.  I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship.  Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.  What's up with the simian?  You mean the lully story?  Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.  So, uh, how was he?  Well I didn't think that was serious. _B_ Ya know I thought that was just a fight.   I love you too.   Should I tell her I ordered tea?  Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.  Okay, then get the lobster!  Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?  You cant tell, but Im trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!  Me? No. You?  Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot? _B_  Yeah?  Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.  Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what Im saying?  Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!  I am so, so, so, so sorry!  You know the hotels?   Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!  You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!  How drunk are you?  What are you guys talking about?  I don't think so.  Sorry, we're on a major flan high.  Really?  Okay, one...two...  I dont care!  I dont care!!  Look, you cant call somebody after this long just to say, In case you didnt notice, I dont like you!  Its me. Im the other guy.  Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?  Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.  That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.  Because of the weekend, we had a fight.  No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married.  Will you be my wife?  Good luck!   Yes, but if its any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it. _B_  Okay.   You wanna share it?  Oh yes!  Yeah, Id love to but Ive tried that so many times they wont even let me in the store anymore.  I dont want to say.  Well yeah! But now that I know that youre having these thoughts, Im back to panic, anxiety, and uh Im definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.  Okay...  ..whose turn is it?  What? Why?  Eh?  You, you are gonna love this.  Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.  Well, there you go.  We're worried about you.  See, that's why we don't let her play.  Oh yeah? That's great!  Youre right, and Im sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I wont say another word tonight.   Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night.  Well, who doesn't love dogs?  Ah, he's a tap dancer!  Yes, some would say that is a lost art.  He's a pimp!  There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp!  Hello?   Hey man, how did the audition go?  So do I.   Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.  Oh, you don't want me on the trip?  Me asking is kind of a sign.  Oh man!!  Is not. _B_  So youre just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?  And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!   Yknow, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!  Look you have to realize I dont think of you as a thin, beautiful woman.  See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is youre Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.   Thats the perfect amount!  Wait! Wait! Wed really love it if you could be there.  You got a man who's a nanny...?

Commercial Break _B_  We said seven!  No, no he went for a walk.  Oh yes! Oh yes!   Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?  Well its just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was the first time I knew that you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.   Water! Water! Water! _B_  No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'.  You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse.   Your family name is Tribbiani.  Hi Ross.  Well, that makes me feel so good.   Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run! Closing Credits _B_  Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.  Oh, good job Joe.  This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela? Joeys  That was an obvious joke, and I didnt think of it. Why didnt I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done! End _B_ Aahhuuhhh.... _B_  Absolutely!  Those were like the best seats ever.   Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?  Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!

Come on Monica, its our Valentines Day. Please? Please-please, please?  Well thats good. Because you didnt! And Im incredibly happy for ya!!  So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.  I know it would make me happy, maam.  No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.   Aren't you...?  What?  Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?  Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.  Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?  Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?  All right! Fine! But its just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I dont want you setting me up with anybody ever again!  Yeah Bunny-rabbit.  No! No! No! I just kissed her.  Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?  Really? Okay. Great!  You look good.  Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.   Okay, hold on.  Okay.   The only way that I said six would be if the sevens, let meet at seven, not at six.   Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring youre about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, Im gonna need to have that back.  But, in exchange Im willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring.  Ew.  Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if youre not careful you may not get married at all this year! _B_  Well thats not fair, youve already had some!  Thats awesome! Thats great! What made you do it?!  What?  That means nothing to me.  Come on! _B_  If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza.   Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.  I did pay for half of it.  Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.  Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!  No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?  Well, its, its yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it? Joeys  Yknow what? Were not sad, were not sad, were just not 21 anymore. Yknow? Im 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour! Joey and  And the moment of joy is upon us.  Oh yeah, thats very nice. Plus, yknow they were free and theyre too small.   That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!  Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up!   And now we're back. Ending Credits _B_ _B_  All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!  Okay.  I cant take the big white dog! You love it!   Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady.  Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail andgenerosity of spirit.  Yes!   Whats this?  Okay.  Janices  Oh, we could do this all day.  Id carry you around in my pocket.  I would but mine doesnt fit. The pants are a little tight.  Okay, one thing at a time.  _B_ _B_  Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.  Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it.  _B_    Right.  So how're you doing?  Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?  Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.  Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!  _B_ Yeah o-, OK, alright. _B_ Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch.  We came over as soon as we saw.  OK.  Thats just a lot of big talk, y'know.  Ohh, thats a good one.  _B_  Hey! Happy birthday.  How is that worse?!  Oh. Oh, God!    We're in a relationship?  Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?   Why to save your dignity my man.  What do we use to split it?  Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joeys chair?  I know.  Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.  Im leaning. This is where I lean.  What is so funny about that?   Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.  And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?  Im an alien. Im an alien.  So um, Mary-Angela, whats your second favorite? Joeys  You cant just call Monicas room.  That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!  Oh my God!  You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.  Oh thanks.  No, but waitwhat if I bought it from you, yknow? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say  $1,500?  Its all very, very good.  So you wanna go uh, mix it up?  Aww, thanks man.   So, are we going in there?  You are gonna be a huge star! Im gonna hug ya!  Oh my good God.  No-no! This is my fiancee  and her heart was set on that ring. You dont want to break her heart now do you?  Skidmarks still got a way with the ladies. _B_  You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.   Who are those people?  Ehh.  Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?  The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.  Hi Monica.  You don't like that show?  Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.  Look, Im sorry! But theres nothing I can do, I think Im in love with her!  I KNOW!!!   Okay.  _B_  Oh, do you not want to?   You guys ready fore the movies?  Im sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why dont you uh, lift up your shirt?  Take a look at this kiddo.  We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras! _B_  Well, maybe you dont marry this one. _B_   Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh Theres more crust on this side. Yknow? So, maybe if I measured  I thought I broke Joeys chair! Thats why I replaced it with mine!  Well, I have kissed over four women.  Do you wanna get under the covers?  Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.  Well, does that mean that youre not going to be wearing yours?  Call.  Okay.   Did you tell her what we talked about?   Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.  Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.  Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?   HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!  Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.  Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?   Would you just please....give me the receipt cause this is great. Its top notch. Joeys  Cause its-its not his last name.  Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, wed really appreciate it.   No he didn't. _B_  Are we in London?  Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.   Open up! Open up! Open up!   Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail.   Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?  All right!!  Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here. Commercial Break _B_  The door hasnt been locked in five years, but okay!  Ready?!  When did I try to give you money?   Im out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?  Oh come on you big faker!  All right! _B_ _B_  Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.  Thats the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!  Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.  Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.  Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock.  I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident.  O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross.   So, let's go.   I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...  Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.  _B_ Ding dong, the psycho's gone.  Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.   Hello. Joey, Rachel, and  Youre right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.   Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion. _B_  I didn't think I was!   Hey.  Oh you wouldnt uh, care. Its just a stupid comic book story.  What?!  Yeah, shes dying Of a cough apparently.  All right, Ill pick that one.   Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?  Okay!    Let me try it on!  Hey Bobby.  Okay. Uh, well dim the lights, dim the lights.  Or turn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go.   So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS?   Please let me stay on this side of the door. _B_  I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like. Agency  _B_ So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid. DIRECTOR'S  No.  So will I. Joeys  We cant tell him, you cant go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.  No, its not like, like Phil Spiderman. Hes a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but theres no Gold Man.  Happy birthday! I'm sorry.   Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?  What the hell is going on?!   Man, she is really gullible.  _B_  Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!  Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I cant get in!  Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.  Im just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that youre okay.   Youre a little high maintenance.  Well that was before all the vaporizing action.  I think so. Yeah, get off me.  Well, somebody should.  _B_   When I was growing up I played the one on the far left. _B_  Oh Im sorry! Do you need a break?  Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.  I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!   I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!   Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them  for us to leave now.  No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..   Oh o-, OK man. _B_ _B_ _B_ _B_ CLOSING CREDITS _B_  Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!  Fine with me.  Man, I gotta get a kid.   Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!  I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.  Oh, I would never bet this apartment. Its too nice.  Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door.  Ending Credits _B_  Ooh, I do! I do! I do!   Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesnt want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assistas his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that cant have lumps in them.   Okay, thats enough honey!  Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Yknow, for you, and  I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain.    Ohhh!  Im gettin my chair back!   It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.   Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman!  Whats this?  Uhh yeah. Yeah, its  right, right down there.  Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?  Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?  You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?  Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.   Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?  Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.  Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesnt mean anything. Joeys   Wax the door shut, were never leaving, ever. _B_  Oh no, now its not gonna make any sense!   I love you.   See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.  All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 330 I am going down to the courthouse.  I can't believe this.  Oh, hey!   Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!  _B_  This is not a sign!  Im sorry. Youre not easy-going, but youre passionate, and thats good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that Im pretty good about making you feel better about that. And thats good too. So, they can say that youre high maintenance, but its okay, because I like maintaining you.  Okay!   I say we go with Careless Whisper.   I can see it from right here. Itll cost you one husband.  Yes, 98.6. Youre gonna be fine. _B_  Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.  Hey! Remember when I had corneas?  Hey! Remember when I had corneas?  Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.  Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone. _B_  Probably because  Hey!  Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that Im sorry. Yknow? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.  Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!  We are switching back, right now!   If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.   What does it say?!  Great! Okay, here.   Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and dont come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my  _B_ The  Yep!  An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didnt wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!  Okay Bob listen uhh, Im the reason you didnt get the job up here.  I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.  Aaaaand....... hernia.  Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend. _B_  I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?  It's gonna be ok. You know that?  No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.   Ill hold you close in my arms.  I cant resist your charms. And love....  Will you excuse me I have to um.....  _B_  Oh, this is horrible, its just horrible.  Can I sleep on your couch?  Closing Credits _B_  Oh, yeah... yeah.  Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, its probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women So, as of 4 oclock tomorrow, Im either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.  Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!  Yeah, well, sorry doesnt bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.  Its an old key!  If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.  Uh-huh   Im off the list.    Maybe we should give them some privacy.   Ni-hi-ice!   Did she see us yet? Did she see us?  Clunkers?! Oh my god!  Joey you broke my chair!!   I dont have your boots.  Do I smell essential oils?  Yeah.  Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.  Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.   Hey.  Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.  Our next cocktail party?   Hey! Joeys  Here, here! Closing Credits _B_ End Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but yknow I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? Cause weve had our first fight, and now we can move on. Yknow, I know for me Nicks pants?  Well, youre gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, were switching it back! Theres nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?  Joey, can I talk to you for a second?   Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!  And you are about to marry a wonderful man!  Hey! Im marrying a dead woman! _B_  Count of three?  The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.   Bob!  I'm sorry man.   Two hours, that lasted!   Really?!  Yeah, just leave me alone for a while.  _B_  Yeah umm, they're called wallets. End I love you!  Now you do that, youre on TV. End  So, you busy Thursday?  Guys?  Ive got something important to tell ya.  Guys?  Guys?!  Im gonna ask Monica to marry me.  Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up?  Im sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?  Well, why dont you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!  Okay.   Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.  Oh yeah, that's what she says. But maybe you're notovulating at all, maybe it's just a clever ruse to get me into bed.  Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.  I know.   Well, I did and it hurt.  That's when I wrote the  _B_ You're obviously not their favorite pet.  Eddie, do you remember yesterday?  You're not a dad. You're not a dad.   No you know I dont mind. Chandler and  Yes!!  Look, I may have jumped the gun here.  Um, I just got out of a relationship and Im not really in a, in a commitment kind of place. Joeys  Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.  Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one! _B_  What?  Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" Im happy all the time!   Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?  No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.   Hey, buddy boy, howd the audition go?   I told you I should not wear this color.    It is so good to see you!   What is going on? The  Two!  Whats going on?  Well that puts me in a difficult position. _B_  Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!  I can't believe the guys missed this.  OK, Phoebs, your turn.  Thank you, sir.  I think so.  _B_ Goodnight.  Yeah, but I bet it works.  Okay. Thanks.  I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.  Yes. Yes.   Nice try.  Okay, how long is this going to go on.   Hey!  Are you hugging the door right now.   Okay. Okay.  What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?  Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us.  Did she look 16?  Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?  L-leaving my troubles behind?  Not to shabby, I got this all off myself using my wifes tools.  Oh my God!  What are you doing here?   You not gonna believe  Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.  Lying is wrong!  No problem roomie.   Uhhhaahh.  Do you remember talking to me yesterday?  I can't believe you got us into trouble. _B_  I know.  Well, you dont you have Captain Hook explain it to her.  Ahhhh, youre not Mary-Angela. Joeys  Yeah, we got, um-hmm.  Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape. End So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?  All right, well Im gonna put my sweats back on.  I dont care, this is our apartment! And they stoleyou stole itour apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. Im getting back right now!   Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!  Im not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.   Yeah, check out the ring.   Arent you just a tinsy bit curious?  Three!   Look  it was a lo-o-ong time ago.  You gotta do it, man.  Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross.   Why dont you use ours across the hall, cause she has problems.  Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.  Well, I-I guess I gotta go.  Hey.  You wanna hug it out?  Look, Monica  Yeah-yeah, me neither. _B_  Good-good-good-good.  How is that ever going to happen?!  It's up to you. _B_  Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise.  Joey!  My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.   Well I think its safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.  Well, youre welcome. And tell them were really glad theyre coming.  Yknow what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.  Oh, its so hard to care when youre this relaxed.   Youre messy.  ...I'm, I'm okay.  Alright! That is it! This is our apartment and you cannot behave this way. Now if you can't act your age, then you shouldn't be here at all. Now, those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out...But they're very important to Monica...And I want you to apologize to her right now.  Sure you do.  I'm a pretty little girl.  The cranberries...?  Sure!  Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?  So what happened?  Sure. What's up?  Ive found.  You hear that! That is her chose, mister Ill let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!!   This is so bad. If-if youre not Mary-Angela, then-then who is? Mary- What about things that are already gold?  No. No, not at all, thats-thats ridiculous.  Yeah?  Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You cant offer anything to us!  Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game!  Last night!  That's not funny.  Oh the humanity.  Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!  Do you want me to be afraid of you?  Right here!    Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!...  Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good!  Whooooaaaa.... Closing Credits _B_  I think I should get the chair!   So we both finished our vows.  Did it turn into sand?  Eh. I thought that was an alp.   Hey!  What's the matter with me? Why I'm such a girl?   Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!  Erica wait!   Hmm mmmhm..  I cant believe you came back.  Its horrible.  Uh, the book?  Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.  Oh-ho, yeah!  It happened in London.  This is not going to work.  Okay, give me a second!  Did you clean up in here?  What are you doing?  Hey!  Yep, pretty much.  Sure, why not?  What are you doing?  Eh!   And dignity.  Well, she probably wasnt familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!  Okay.    Hey!  I married Fred Sanford!  That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...  You sure?   Not to mention the cold sores.    Not to mention the cold sores.   Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.  _B_ Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?  Oh sweet Moses.  Wh-what?  Oh, this is soo bad.  Mary- Okay, lets play my game now.  Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!  Stripping!  Yay!  I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.   Hey.  Really?  Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!  Because you  broke a chair and you  broke a chair! The only one around here that hasnt broke a chair, is me!  Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey!    No. No, I wont. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didnt want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.  Oh so there can’t be any yelling.  Ok...That's better. Now I want you to apologize to each other, and mean it. Amy &  He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him!   You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.   Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?  And, a lemon lime.  _B_ Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.  I'm free! I'm free!  Would you come on! Come on! _B_ Thank you. _B_  What do you mean?  Well believe it baby!  Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.   Hey.  Totally worth it!  The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.  You are so great! I love you!   Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!  Oh, all right.  End Oh Im so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?   You have no trouble telling time now right?  No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!  Oh, you dont know.  Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?  Get in here!  Hey, and you can not smoke in here!   Merry Christmas.  Hey! Howd it go?   You told her?!  No, honey youre not sick! Look, I dont love you because youre organized, I love you in spite of that.  Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.  Okay.  I love you so much.   Really?   Really?  _B_ Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker.  Ah, there we go.  Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom!  Hey-hey good lookin!  Varrrrrrrrroom.  All right, Ill leave. My beds so boring. End No Joey! No Joey! Dont Joey! Joey!  Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper. Closing Credits _B_  Okay!  Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.  I know.   Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.  Thats totally understandable.  Okay.   HeyyyyWhat?  Well, wheres the logic in that?!  Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e   We’re moving to Tulsa  By the way, that fight was totally arousing.  Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.  Not her! _B_  And last but not least. _B_  Ahhhh.  Y'know what, it doesnt matter, cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!  Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!   Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."  No!  I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didnt ask me to go do it with her in the vault.  Good night.  No-no-no-no-no! You can't!  Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!  All right.   Wha-  Really?  Quick! What time is it?!   Is that what youre thinking about right now?  Why? Mr.  Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet.  Here, here! _B_  Hey! How was lunch?

So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road.  Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?   What?  No problem roomie.   Yes, if it really doesnt mean anything, because you know that Im just not ready  Okay!  I was gonna wait til uh, it was official yknow? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because youre my best friends.  Helen drinks.  Will you marry me?  _B_  All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down!  What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and Ill bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right? The  So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!   No! No! No!  Were back!  Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh!  I can’t, I can’t hear you.  _B_  Oh yeah? Well, thanks!   Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.  But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?   Hey.  Phoebe, Ross,  Hey.  Phoebe, Ross,  Uh, yes, yes it is.  Were not gonna lose to girls.  Y'know what, I can handle it, handles my middle name.

Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now?  Eldad come here!   Hi, how are ya?   I dont care, she slept with me.  So you understand, Id feel a lot more comfortable if you didnt tell people what happened. Yknow, Im a little Im a little embarrassed about it. Mr.  Yknow when I said that because were getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?  Well, I ended up telling her everything.  Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.  Hey.  The floating heads do make a good point.  You still want that baby?   Soo... you girls having fun?   Oh, really?  May I help you?

We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this.  Well yeah, but then  Im sorry youre here with me instead of Roger.  Really? You got us a chick and a duck?  Really? You got us a chick and a duck?  Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Lets take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs dont mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and thats just an ordinary pig not even a pig thats good at sports!  Depends on what you mean by we. _B_  Well, I could make it seem like hes here.  "Heres some little known facts about cous-cous. They didnt add the second cous until 1979."   If marriage worked, Id be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.  Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?

You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other!

Well why didnt you stop her?! Why didnt you just tell her it was a plan?!

No, there were two.  I cant believe I ruined this.  Oh yeah. Ending Credits _B_  Oh my God.   Okay!  Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought  Wait a minute, I-I can do this.  I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you,  you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.  And if youll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.  Monica, will you marry me?   Look around, you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!   Oh, okay.   Oh, it's gonna be okay.   Sure. Where?
